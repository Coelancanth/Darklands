### TD_047: Strategic Error Handling Boundaries with LanguageExt
**Archived**: 2025-09-17
**Final Status**: Completed
---
**Status**: Done ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (3.5h actual)
**Priority**: Important - Debugging complexity
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:29 (Tech Lead)
**Revised**: 2025-09-17 09:58 (Tech Lead - Strategic boundaries approach)
**Completed**: 2025-09-17 10:14 (Dev Engineer - All conversions complete)
**Complexity**: 3/10 (reduced from 5/10 with clear boundaries)
**Markers**: [ERROR-HANDLING] [TECHNICAL-DEBT]

**Strategic Approach**: Pure Fin<T> in business logic, try-catch at system boundaries

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

#### Application Layer Successfully Converted (10 try-blocks ‚Üí Pure Fin<T>):
1. **InMemoryVisionStateService.cs**: 7 try-blocks ‚Üí FinSucc/FinFail patterns
   - Converted all dictionary operations to safe Fin<T> returns
   - Eliminated defensive try-catch around ConcurrentDictionary operations
   - Added safe string truncation for logging (ToString()[..8] ‚Üí safe bounds checking)

2. **UIEventForwarder.cs**: 1 try-block ‚Üí Functional composition
   - Extracted `ForwardEventToUI()` private method returning Fin<T>
   - Used `.Match()` pattern to handle success/failure in MediatR boundary
   - Maintained non-throwing behavior required by MediatR interface

3. **VisionPerformanceConsoleCommandHandler.cs**: 1 try-block ‚Üí Pure functional flow
   - Removed try-catch wrapper, already using functional patterns internally
   - Cleaned up `Fin<string>.Succ` ‚Üí `FinSucc` for consistency
   - Performance report generation now purely functional

4. **CalculateFOVConsoleCommandHandler.cs**: 1 try-block ‚Üí Monadic composition
   - Converted complex method to `.Bind()` and `.Map()` chain
   - Added safe string truncation for actor ID logging
   - Elegant functional flow from grid ‚Üí FOV ‚Üí report generation

#### Architectural Boundaries Documented:
- **Infrastructure**: `GameStrapper.cs` marked with `// ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY: try-catch intentionally used for system initialization`
- **Presentation**: `GridPresenter.cs` marked with `// ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY: try-catch intentionally used for Godot integration`

### üéØ Final Architecture Achieved:
```
Layer               | Error Handling    | Status
--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------
Domain              | Pure Fin<T> ‚úÖ    | Pure business logic (complete)
Application         | Pure Fin<T> ‚úÖ    | Functional composition (complete)
Infrastructure      | try-catch ‚úÖ      | System boundaries (documented)
Presentation        | try-catch ‚úÖ      | Godot integration (documented)
Pipeline Behaviors  | try-catch ‚úÖ      | MediatR boundaries (documented)
```

### ‚úÖ All Success Criteria Met:
- ‚úÖ Domain layer: Zero try-catch blocks in business logic
- ‚úÖ Application layer: Zero try-catch blocks (4 files converted)
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: try-catch documented as intentional boundaries
- ‚úÖ Presentation: try-catch documented as intentional boundaries
- ‚úÖ Clear boundary documentation in code comments
- ‚úÖ All 664 tests pass (100% success rate)

### üìä Impact Metrics:
- **Code Quality**: Application layer now uses consistent functional error handling
- **Debugging**: Error flows are explicit and composable via Fin<T> chains
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between business logic (functional) and system boundaries (imperative)
- **Testing**: Zero regressions, all existing behavior preserved
- **Architecture**: Strategic boundaries successfully established and documented

**Technical Debt Resolved**: Application layer error handling inconsistency eliminated while respecting framework integration needs.
