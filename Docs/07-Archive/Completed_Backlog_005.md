### TD_047: Strategic Error Handling Boundaries with LanguageExt
**Archived**: 2025-09-17
**Final Status**: Completed
---
**Status**: Done ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (3.5h actual)
**Priority**: Important - Debugging complexity
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:29 (Tech Lead)
**Revised**: 2025-09-17 09:58 (Tech Lead - Strategic boundaries approach)
**Completed**: 2025-09-17 10:14 (Dev Engineer - All conversions complete)
**Complexity**: 3/10 (reduced from 5/10 with clear boundaries)
**Markers**: [ERROR-HANDLING] [TECHNICAL-DEBT]

**Strategic Approach**: Pure Fin<T> in business logic, try-catch at system boundaries

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

#### Application Layer Successfully Converted (10 try-blocks ‚Üí Pure Fin<T>):
1. **InMemoryVisionStateService.cs**: 7 try-blocks ‚Üí FinSucc/FinFail patterns
   - Converted all dictionary operations to safe Fin<T> returns
   - Eliminated defensive try-catch around ConcurrentDictionary operations
   - Added safe string truncation for logging (ToString()[..8] ‚Üí safe bounds checking)

2. **UIEventForwarder.cs**: 1 try-block ‚Üí Functional composition
   - Extracted `ForwardEventToUI()` private method returning Fin<T>
   - Used `.Match()` pattern to handle success/failure in MediatR boundary
   - Maintained non-throwing behavior required by MediatR interface

3. **VisionPerformanceConsoleCommandHandler.cs**: 1 try-block ‚Üí Pure functional flow
   - Removed try-catch wrapper, already using functional patterns internally
   - Cleaned up `Fin<string>.Succ` ‚Üí `FinSucc` for consistency
   - Performance report generation now purely functional

4. **CalculateFOVConsoleCommandHandler.cs**: 1 try-block ‚Üí Monadic composition
   - Converted complex method to `.Bind()` and `.Map()` chain
   - Added safe string truncation for actor ID logging
   - Elegant functional flow from grid ‚Üí FOV ‚Üí report generation

#### Architectural Boundaries Documented:
- **Infrastructure**: `GameStrapper.cs` marked with `// ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY: try-catch intentionally used for system initialization`
- **Presentation**: `GridPresenter.cs` marked with `// ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY: try-catch intentionally used for Godot integration`

### üéØ Final Architecture Achieved:
```
Layer               | Error Handling    | Status
--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------
Domain              | Pure Fin<T> ‚úÖ    | Pure business logic (complete)
Application         | Pure Fin<T> ‚úÖ    | Functional composition (complete)
Infrastructure      | try-catch ‚úÖ      | System boundaries (documented)
Presentation        | try-catch ‚úÖ      | Godot integration (documented)
Pipeline Behaviors  | try-catch ‚úÖ      | MediatR boundaries (documented)
```

### ‚úÖ All Success Criteria Met:
- ‚úÖ Domain layer: Zero try-catch blocks in business logic
- ‚úÖ Application layer: Zero try-catch blocks (4 files converted)
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: try-catch documented as intentional boundaries
- ‚úÖ Presentation: try-catch documented as intentional boundaries
- ‚úÖ Clear boundary documentation in code comments
- ‚úÖ All 664 tests pass (100% success rate)

### üìä Impact Metrics:
- **Code Quality**: Application layer now uses consistent functional error handling
- **Debugging**: Error flows are explicit and composable via Fin<T> chains
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between business logic (functional) and system boundaries (imperative)
- **Testing**: Zero regressions, all existing behavior preserved
- **Architecture**: Strategic boundaries successfully established and documented

**Technical Debt Resolved**: Application layer error handling inconsistency eliminated while respecting framework integration needs.

### TD_057: Fix Nested MediatR Handler Anti-Pattern
**Archived**: 2025-09-17
**Final Status**: Completed
---
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (2h actual)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Violates core MediatR principles
**Created**: 2025-09-17 09:47 (Tech Lead)
**Completed**: 2025-09-17 10:53 (Dev Engineer)
**Complexity**: 3/10
**Markers**: [MEDIATR] [ANTI-PATTERN] [REFACTORING]

**Problem**: ExecuteAttackCommandHandler.cs:210 calls `_mediator.Send(damageCommand)` - violates MediatR principles
**Impact**: Hidden dependencies, re-triggers entire pipeline, complex testing, performance overhead
**Solution**: Extract damage logic into IDamageService, inject into both handlers

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** (2025-09-17 10:53):
‚úÖ Tests: 664/664 passing (27s execution time)

**What I Actually Did**:
- Created `IDamageService` interface in `src/Darklands.Domain/Combat/Services/IDamageService.cs`
- Implemented `DamageService` in `src/Darklands.Application/Combat/Services/DamageService.cs`
- Refactored `ExecuteAttackCommandHandler` to inject `IDamageService` instead of calling `_mediator.Send()`
- Simplified `DamageActorCommandHandler` from 50+ lines to 10 lines (delegates to service)
- Registered `IDamageService` in `GameStrapper.cs` DI container
- Updated all tests with proper mocking: `TestDamageService` for unit tests
- Fixed logging redundancy: moved detailed logs to Debug level, kept key events at Info

**Problems Encountered**:
- Compilation errors with namespace resolution for `ActorId` and `Actor` types
  ‚Üí Solution: Added proper using directives and fully qualified type names
- Test failures due to constructor signature changes
  ‚Üí Workaround: Created comprehensive test mocks for `IDamageService`
- Redundant logging creating noise in combat logs
  ‚Üí Solution: Moved implementation details to Debug level, fixed placeholder formatting

**Technical Debt Created**:
- None - clean implementation following established patterns

**Lessons for Future Refactoring**:
- Domain services eliminate MediatR anti-patterns effectively
- Functional error handling with `Fin<T>` integrates seamlessly
- Test refactoring requires matching service abstractions to implementation changes
- Logging levels need careful consideration to balance detail vs noise

**Branch**: `feat/td-057-fix-mediatR-antipattern` (pushed)
**Commits**:
- `7b09699`: Main refactoring with IDamageService implementation
- `5e3ec76`: Logging improvements (fixed placeholders, reduced redundancy)

### TD_058: Fix MediatR Pipeline Behavior Registration Order
**Archived**: 2025-09-17
**Final Status**: Completed
---
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: XS (10 minutes actual)
**Priority**: High - Exception handling broken
**Created**: 2025-09-17 09:47 (Tech Lead)
**Completed**: 2025-09-17 11:06 (Dev Engineer)
**Complexity**: 1/10
**Markers**: [MEDIATR] [PIPELINE] [QUICK-FIX]

**Problem**: GameStrapper.cs:227-230 registers LoggingBehavior before ErrorHandlingBehavior
**Impact**: Exceptions from LoggingBehavior won't be caught by error handler
**Solution**: Swap registration order - ErrorHandlingBehavior must be FIRST

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** (2025-09-17 11:06):
‚úÖ Tests: 664/664 passing (30s execution time)

**What I Actually Did**:
- Fixed registration order in `GameStrapper.cs:227-231` - swapped ErrorHandlingBehavior to be first
- Added clear comment explaining why ErrorHandlingBehavior must be outermost wrapper
- Verified both behaviors are properly registered in MediatR pipeline

**Problems Encountered**:
- None - clean 2-line fix with comment update

**Technical Debt Created**:
- None - this was a pure bug fix

**Lessons for Future Pipeline Work**:
- MediatR pipeline behaviors wrap in registration order (first = outermost)
- ErrorHandlingBehavior MUST be outermost to catch exceptions from all inner behaviors
- Simple fixes still require comprehensive test validation

**Fixed Pipeline Flow**:
```
BEFORE: Request ‚Üí LoggingBehavior ‚Üí ErrorHandlingBehavior ‚Üí Handler
AFTER:  Request ‚Üí ErrorHandlingBehavior ‚Üí LoggingBehavior ‚Üí Handler
```

**Branch**: `feat/td-057-fix-mediatR-antipattern` (will be committed)
