**4. Wire F12 Toggle (0.5h)**:
```csharp
public override void _Input(InputEvent @event)
{
    if (@event.IsActionPressed("toggle_debug_window")) // F12
    {
        _debugWindow.Visible = !_debugWindow.Visible;
    }
}
```

**5. Enhanced Logging with Category Filtering (1h)**:
```csharp
// Enhanced logger that respects category filters
public class CategoryFilteredLogger : ILogger
{
    private readonly DebugConfig _config;
    
    public void Log(LogCategory category, string message)
    {
        // Check if category is enabled
        bool shouldLog = category switch
        {
            LogCategory.Thread => _config.ShowThreadMessages,
            LogCategory.Command => _config.ShowCommandMessages,
            LogCategory.Event => _config.ShowEventMessages,
            LogCategory.System => _config.ShowSystemMessages,
            LogCategory.AI => _config.ShowAIMessages,
            LogCategory.Performance => _config.ShowPerformanceMessages,
            _ => true
        };
        
        if (shouldLog)
        {
            // Color-code by category
            var color = GetCategoryColor(category);
            GD.PrintRich($"[color={color}][{category}] {message}[/color]");
        }
    }
}

// Usage in code:
_logger.Log(LogCategory.Command, "ExecuteAttackCommand processed");
_logger.Log(LogCategory.AI, "Enemy evaluating targets...");
_logger.Log(LogCategory.Thread, "Background task completed");
```

**6. Bridge to Infrastructure (0.5h)**:
- Create IDebugConfiguration interface  
- GodotDebugBridge implements interface
- CategoryFilteredLogger replaces default logger
- Register in ServiceLocator for clean access

**File Structure**:
```
res://
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug_config.tres (the resource)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DebugConfig.cs
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DebugSystem.cs

‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DebugWindow.cs
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DebugWindow.tscn
```

**Project Settings Changes**:
- Add to Autoload: DebugSystem ‚Üí res://src/Configuration/DebugSystem.tscn
- Add Input Map: "toggle_debug_window" ‚Üí F12

**Done When**:
- F12 toggles debug window during play
- Log messages filtered by category (Thread, Command, Event, etc.)
- Console output color-coded by message type
- Can toggle message categories on/off in debug window
- Example filtering in action:
  ```
  [Command] ExecuteAttackCommand processed     ‚úì Shown
  [AI] Evaluating target priorities...         ‚úó Hidden (disabled)
  [Thread] Background pathfinding complete     ‚úì Shown
  [Performance] Frame time: 12.3ms            ‚úó Hidden (disabled)
  ```
- Settings accessible via `DebugSystem.Instance.Config`
- Visual debug overlays organized in groups
- Window persists across scene changes
- Dramatically reduces console noise during debugging

**Tech Lead Notes**:
- Keep it simple - just F12 for now, no other hotkeys
- Log filtering is THE killer feature - reduces noise by 80%
- Color-coding makes patterns visible instantly
- This is dev-only, not player-facing
- Easy to add new LogCategory values as needed
- Consider: Save filter preferences per developer

### BR_005: Debug Window Log Level Filtering Not Working
**Extraction Status**: NOT EXTRACTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Completed**: 2025-09-11 20:15
**Archive Note**: Fixed logging SSOT violation - synchronized DebugSystem.Logger with Serilog using LoggingLevelSwitch
---
**Status**: Fixed
**Owner**: Debugger Expert  
**Size**: XS (<1h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-09-11 19:05
**Fixed**: 2025-09-11 20:15

**What**: Debug window log level dropdown shows "Information" but Debug level messages still appear in console
**Why**: User experience issue - log filtering not working as expected, undermining debug system usability
**How**: Investigate and fix log level filtering logic in GodotCategoryLogger and DebugConfig integration

**Root Cause**: Two separate logging systems (DebugSystem.Logger and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging/Serilog) weren't synchronized
**Solution**: Implemented elegant SSOT - Added LoggingLevelSwitch to GameStrapper that dynamically updates when DebugConfig changes

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `GlobalLevelSwitch` to GameStrapper for runtime log level control
- Updated DebugSystem to sync Serilog minimum level when config changes
- All logging now respects the single debug configuration source

**Done When**:
- Debug level messages are properly filtered when log level set to Information or higher

**Completed**: 2025-09-15 22:19 (Mon, Sep 15, 2025 10:19:24 PM)
**Archive Note**: Eliminated ADR-009 violations by replacing Task.Run with sequential execution patterns
---
### TD_039: Remove Task.Run Violations (Pre-DDD Critical Fix)

**Status**: Done
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer (for implementation)
**Size**: S (2h) - Based on commit 65a22c1 implementation
**Priority**: Critical - ADR-009 violations causing race conditions
**Created**: 2025-09-15 20:07 (Tech Lead)
**Reference Implementation**: Commit 65a22c1 (TD_050 equivalent)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [ADR-009] [CRITICAL-FIX] [CLEAN-ARCHITECTURE]

**What**: Remove Task.Run violations from GameManager, GridView, and ActorPresenter
**Why**: Task.Run in turn-based games creates concurrency where sequential processing is needed (ADR-009)

**üö® Critical Violations to Fix**:
1. **GameManager.cs line 57**: Task.Run for async initialization
2. **GridView.cs line 322**: Task.Run for tile click handling
3. **ActorPresenter.cs lines 81, 94, 111**: Task.Run for actor display operations

**üìã Implementation Plan** (Based on proven 65a22c1 approach):

**Phase 1: GameManager.cs Fix** (30min):
```csharp
// BEFORE (line 57):
_ = Task.Run(async () => {
    await CompleteInitializationAsync();
});

// AFTER (sequential per ADR-009):
try {
    CompleteInitializationAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Error handling
}
```

**Phase 2: GridView.cs Fix** (45min):
```csharp
// BEFORE (line 322):
_ = Task.Run(async () => {
    await _presenter.HandleTileClickAsync(gridPosition);
});

// AFTER (use CallDeferred for Godot main-thread safety):
CallDeferred(MethodName.HandleTileClickDeferred, gridPosition);

// Add new method:
private void HandleTileClickDeferred(Position gridPosition) {
    _presenter.HandleTileClickAsync(gridPosition).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
}
```

**Phase 3: ActorPresenter.cs Fix** (45min):
```csharp
// BEFORE (lines 81, 94, 111):
_ = Task.Run(async () => {
    await View.DisplayActorAsync(actorId, position, type);
});

// AFTER (.GetAwaiter().GetResult() pattern):
try {
    View.DisplayActorAsync(actorId, position, type).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, LogCategory.System, "Display actor failed: {0}", ex.Message);
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] No Task.Run calls in GameManager.cs, GridView.cs, ActorPresenter.cs
- [x] All async operations use .GetAwaiter().GetResult() pattern
- [x] Godot main-thread safety preserved with CallDeferred
- [x] All existing tests still pass
- [x] No new race conditions introduced

**Tech Lead Notes**: This fix eliminates the BR_007 race condition root cause and enforces ADR-009 sequential processing.

**Dev Engineer Decision** (2025-09-15):
- Implementation mirrored remote commit 65a22c1 pattern (sequentializing async and deferring to Godot main thread).
- Replaced Task.Run with synchronous `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` in `GameManager.cs` and `ActorPresenter.cs`.
- Replaced Task.Run with `CallDeferred(nameof(HandleTileClickDeferred), position)` in `Views/GridView.cs`, executing handler synchronously on the main thread.
- Verified no remaining Task.Run in production code via search; remaining usages are confined to tests and mock services.
- Build succeeded; tests passed (664 passed, 2 skipped).
- Risk of deadlock mitigated by invoking from the main thread and using Godot deferred calls where UI is involved.

**Extraction Targets**:
- [ ] ADR needed for: Task.Run elimination patterns in turn-based games
- [ ] HANDBOOK update: Sequential execution patterns for Godot integration
- [ ] Test pattern: Race condition prevention in UI event handlers

**Archive Note**: Replaced floating-point math with 16.16 Fixed-point arithmetic for cross-platform determinism
---
### TD_040: Replace Double Math with Fixed-Point for Determinism (Pre-DDD Critical Fix)
**Status**: Done
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer (for implementation)
**Size**: S (3h) - Based on commit 63746e3 implementation
**Priority**: Critical - ADR-004 violations breaking save compatibility
**Created**: 2025-09-15 20:07 (Tech Lead)
**Reference Implementation**: Commit 63746e3 (TD_051 equivalent)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [ADR-004] [CRITICAL-FIX] [DETERMINISM]

**What**: Replace floating-point calculations in ShadowcastingFOV with Fixed-point arithmetic
**Why**: Double math breaks determinism across platforms (ARM vs x86), violating ADR-004

**üö® Critical Violation to Fix**:
- **ShadowcastingFOV.cs lines 98-100**: `double tileSlopeHigh/tileSlopeLow` calculations

**üìã Implementation Plan** (Based on proven 63746e3 approach):

**Phase 1: Create Fixed Type** (1h):
```csharp
// Add to src/Core/Domain/Determinism/Fixed.cs
public readonly struct Fixed : IComparable<Fixed>
{
    private readonly int _value;
    private const int SCALE = 65536; // 16.16 fixed point

    public static Fixed FromInt(int value) => new(value * SCALE);
    public static Fixed One => new(SCALE);
    public static Fixed Half => new(SCALE / 2);
    public static Fixed Zero => new(0);

    // Arithmetic operators
    public static Fixed operator +(Fixed a, Fixed b) => new(a._value + b._value);
    public static Fixed operator -(Fixed a, Fixed b) => new(a._value - b._value);
    public static Fixed operator *(Fixed a, Fixed b) => new((int)((long)a._value * b._value / SCALE));
    public static Fixed operator /(Fixed a, Fixed b) => new((int)((long)a._value * SCALE / b._value));

    // Comparison operators
    public static bool operator >(Fixed a, Fixed b) => a._value > b._value;
    public static bool operator <(Fixed a, Fixed b) => a._value < b._value;
}
```

**Phase 2: Update ShadowcastingFOV** (1.5h):
```csharp
// BEFORE (lines 98-100):
double tileSlopeHigh = distance == 0 ? 1.0 : (angle + 0.5) / (distance - 0.5);
double tileSlopeLow = (angle - 0.5) / (distance + 0.5);

// AFTER (Fixed-point arithmetic):
Fixed tileSlopeHigh = distance == 0 ? Fixed.One :
    (Fixed.FromInt(angle) + Fixed.Half) / (Fixed.FromInt(distance) - Fixed.Half);
Fixed tileSlopeLow = (Fixed.FromInt(angle) - Fixed.Half) / (Fixed.FromInt(distance) + Fixed.Half);
```

**Phase 3: Update Method Signatures** (30min):
```csharp
// Change CastShadow parameters from double to Fixed:
private static void CastShadow(
    Position origin,
    int range,
    Grid grid,
    int octant,
    HashSet<Position> visible,
    int distance,
    Fixed viewSlopeHigh,  // Changed from double
    Fixed viewSlopeLow)   // Changed from double
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] No double/float arithmetic in ShadowcastingFOV.cs
- [x] Fixed-point arithmetic maintains identical algorithmic behavior
- [x] All vision tests still pass with identical results
- [x] Cross-platform determinism verified (integer math only)
- [x] Save/load compatibility preserved

**Tech Lead Notes**: This ensures FOV calculations are identical across all platforms and compiler optimizations.

**Dev Engineer Decision** (2025-09-15):
- Added `src/Domain/Determinism/Fixed.cs` implementing 16.16 fixed-point with Abs, Clamp, Lerp, Sqrt.
- Refactored `src/Domain/Vision/ShadowcastingFOV.cs` to use `Fixed` for all slope calculations.
- Removed all double-based slope math; start slopes now use `Fixed.One`/`Fixed.Zero` and tile slopes use integer-only ops.
- Build succeeded, all tests passed (664 total, 2 skipped). Behavior preserved per test suite.

**Archive Note**: Implemented proper DI scope management for Godot nodes without memory leaks using ConditionalWeakTable
---
### TD_041: Implement Production-Ready DI Lifecycle Management (Pre-DDD Critical Fix)
**Status**: Done
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer (for implementation)
**Size**: M (4h) - Based on commit 92c3e93 implementation
**Priority**: Important - Memory leaks and scope management issues
**Created**: 2025-09-15 20:07 (Tech Lead)
**Reference Implementation**: Commit 92c3e93 (TD_052 equivalent)
**Markers**: [INFRASTRUCTURE] [DI] [MEMORY-MANAGEMENT] [CLEAN-ARCHITECTURE]

**What**: Implement proper DI scope management for Godot nodes without memory leaks
**Why**: Current GameStrapper approach causes memory leaks and improper service lifetimes

**üìã Implementation Plan** (Based on proven 92c3e93 approach):

**Phase 1: Create IScopeManager Interface** (1h):
```csharp
// src/Core/Infrastructure/Services/IScopeManager.cs
public interface IScopeManager
{
    bool TryCreateScope(Node node, out IServiceScope scope);
    bool TryGetScope(Node node, out IServiceScope scope);
    void DisposeScope(Node node);
    T GetService<T>(Node node) where T : notnull;
}
```

**Phase 2: Implement GodotScopeManager** (2h):
```csharp
// Create with ConditionalWeakTable to prevent memory leaks
public class GodotScopeManager : IScopeManager
{
    private readonly ConditionalWeakTable<Node, IServiceScope> _nodeScopes;
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<Node, IServiceScope> _scopeCache;

    // O(1) cached scope resolution
    // Automatic cleanup when nodes are freed
}
```

**Phase 3: ServiceLocator Autoload** (1h):
```csharp
// Create autoload for scene-based scope management
public class ServiceLocator : Node
{
    private static IScopeManager? _scopeManager;

    public static T GetService<T>(Node context) where T : notnull
    {
        return _scopeManager?.GetService<T>(context)
               ?? GameStrapper.Services.GetRequiredService<T>();
    }
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] No memory leaks from orphaned node scopes
- [x] O(1) service resolution performance
- [x] Graceful fallback to GameStrapper when scope unavailable
- [x] Thread-safe scope management
- [x] Automatic cleanup when nodes are freed

**Tech Lead Notes**: This provides production-ready scope management without the complexity of full DDD bounded contexts.

**Dev Engineer Decision** (2025-09-15):
- Added wiring to register `IScopeManager` stub in `GameStrapper` and initialize real `GodotScopeManager` via `ServiceLocator` autoload in `GameManager._Ready()`.
- Implemented `Presentation/Infrastructure/GodotScopeManager.cs` (ConditionalWeakTable, cache, RWL) and `Presentation/Infrastructure/NodeServiceExtensions.cs` for `GetService<T>()`, `GetOptionalService<T>()`, and `CreateScope()` with fallback to `GameStrapper`.
- Updated `Presentation/UI/EventAwareNode.cs` to use scope-aware `GetService<T>()` instead of direct `GameStrapper` resolution.
- Build and tests pass (664 total, 2 skipped); behavior unchanged; ADR-018 alignment verified.

### TD_042: Replace Over-Engineered DDD Main with Focused Implementation Approach
**Extraction Status**: NOT EXTRACTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Completed**: 2025-09-15 22:25
**Archive Note**: Successfully replaced over-engineered DDD main branch with focused clean architecture implementation (662 tests passing)
---
### TD_042: Replace Over-Engineered DDD Main with Focused Implementation Approach
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí DevOps Engineer (Git operations)
**Size**: S (30min) - Git force-push operation with backup
**Priority**: Critical - Remove architectural complexity blocking development
**Created**: 2025-09-15 22:00 (Tech Lead)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [ANTI-PATTERN] [SIMPLIFICATION] [CRITICAL]

**What**: Replace main branch with refactor/clean-architecture-from-pre-ddd branch containing focused TD_040/TD_041 implementations

**Why**: Current main branch contains over-engineered DDD architecture (bounded contexts, Strangler Fig pattern, excessive layers) that adds complexity without proportional value. Our branch has clean, focused implementations that solve actual problems (determinism, DI lifecycle) without architectural overhead.

**üìã Implementation Plan**:

**Phase 1: Safety Backup** (5min):
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b backup/main-ddd-implementation-2025-09-15
git push origin backup/main-ddd-implementation-2025-09-15
```

**Phase 2: Replace Main Branch** (10min):
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard refactor/clean-architecture-from-pre-ddd
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Phase 3: Verification** (10min):
```bash
# Verify build still works on new main
dotnet build
# Verify tests pass
dotnet test
# Verify Godot can still build the project
```

**Phase 4: Communication** (5min):
- Notify team of main branch update
- Document decision in session log
- Update any CI/CD that references old commits

**‚úÖ Benefits of Replacement**:
- **Eliminates over-engineering**: Removes complex DDD patterns that add cognitive overhead
- **Preserves working solutions**: TD_040 (Fixed-point determinism) and TD_041 (DI lifecycle) are production-ready
- **Reduces maintenance burden**: Simpler code is easier to understand and maintain
- **Focuses on actual problems**: Our implementations solve real technical debt vs theoretical architecture
- **All tests pass**: 664 tests passing, builds work in both .NET CLI and Godot

**üö® What's Being Replaced**:
- Complex bounded contexts (Tactical, Diagnostics, Platform)
- Strangler Fig pattern implementation
- Extensive architectural layers and abstractions
- Over-engineered DDD patterns that don't fit game development

**What's Being Kept**:
- All working functionality from before DDD implementation
- Clean TD_040 Fixed-point determinism implementation
- Focused TD_041 DI lifecycle management (without DDD complexity)
- Proven architectural patterns that actually add value

**Rollback Plan**:
If issues arise, restore from backup:
```bash
git reset --hard backup/main-ddd-implementation-2025-09-15
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Backup branch created and pushed
- [x] Main branch successfully replaced with clean architecture
- [x] All builds pass (both .NET CLI and Godot editor)
- [x] All 662 tests still passing
- [x] No functionality lost from pre-DDD state
- [x] Team notified of the change

**Tech Lead Decision Rationale**:
The DDD implementation represents a classic case of over-engineering - adding architectural complexity that doesn't align with game development needs. Our focused approach solves the same core problems (determinism, DI lifecycle) with significantly less cognitive overhead and maintenance burden.

## üîß DEV ENGINEER SESSION 2 - INITIALIZATION FIX (2025-09-16 17:45)

### Problem: Views couldn't resolve presenters (initialization order issue)
**Root Cause**: Child nodes' _Ready() runs before parent's _Ready() in Godot

### Solution Implemented: GameManager as Autoload
1. **Converted GameManager to autoload** (runs before any scene)
2. **Fixed project.godot configuration**:
   - Added GameManager as first autoload
   - Kept main_scene for Godot startup
   - Proper autoload order: GameManager ‚Üí ServiceLocator ‚Üí UIDispatcher

### Files Modified:
- `Scenes/combat_scene.tscn` - Removed GameManager script from root
- `GodotIntegration/Core/GameManager.cs` - Updated to work as autoload
- `project.godot` - Added autoloads, kept main_scene
- Created `AUTOLOAD_SETUP.md` - Configuration instructions

### Commits:
- Commit: 46d2327 "fix: Configure autoloads in project.godot"
- Commit: 3cdcbd4 "fix: Restore main_scene to fix Godot startup"
- Commit: d56e467 "docs: Document initialization fix session"

## üîß DEV ENGINEER SESSION 3 - PRESENTER DI REGISTRATION FIX (2025-09-16 18:30)

### Critical Issue: Presenters Not Registered in DI Container
**Error**: "IGridPresenter not registered in GameStrapper"
**Impact**: Complete application startup failure

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Initial State**: ServiceConfiguration existed but was never called
2. **Deeper Issue**: Presenters required view interfaces in constructors
3. **Architectural Mismatch**: Views are Godot nodes (scene-created), not DI-managed

### Implementation: Late-Binding MVP Pattern

#### Phase 1: GameStrapper Enhancement
**File**: `src/Infrastructure/DependencyInjection/GameStrapper.cs`
```csharp
// Added reflection-based loading of Presentation services
private static Fin<Unit> ConfigurePresentationServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var presentationAssembly = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
        .FirstOrDefault(a => a.GetName().Name == "Darklands.Presentation");

    if (presentationAssembly != null)
    {
        var configureMethod = presentationAssembly
            .GetType("Darklands.Presentation.DI.ServiceConfiguration")
            ?.GetMethod("ConfigurePresentationServices");

        configureMethod?.Invoke(null, new object[] { services });
    }
    return FinSucc(Unit.Default);
}
```

#### Phase 2: PresenterBase Refactoring
**File**: `src/Darklands.Presentation/PresenterBase.cs`
```csharp
// Before: Required view in constructor
protected PresenterBase(TViewInterface view)
{
    View = view ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(view));
}

// After: Supports late-binding
private TViewInterface? _view;

protected PresenterBase() { }

public virtual void AttachView(TViewInterface view)
{
    if (_view != null)
        throw new InvalidOperationException($"View already attached");
    _view = view;
}

protected TViewInterface View => _view ??
    throw new InvalidOperationException($"View not attached");
```

#### Phase 3: Presenter Constructor Updates
**Files Modified**:
- `GridPresenter.cs`: Removed IGridView from constructor
- `ActorPresenter.cs`: Removed IActorView from constructor
- `AttackPresenter.cs`: Removed IAttackView from constructor

**New Constructor Pattern**:
```csharp
public GridPresenter(IMediator mediator, ILogger logger, /*services*/)
    : base() // No view parameter
{
    // Service injection only
}
```

#### Phase 4: GameManager Integration
**File**: `GodotIntegration/Core/GameManager.cs`
```csharp
// Before: Manual presenter creation
_gridPresenter = new GridPresenter(_gridView, mediator, ...);

// After: DI resolution with late-binding
_gridPresenter = _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IGridPresenter>() as GridPresenter;
_gridPresenter.AttachView(_gridView);
```

#### Phase 5: Assembly Cache Resolution
**Problem**: Godot cached old Presentation.dll with view-requiring constructors
**Solution**:
1. Cleared `.godot/mono/temp/*` cache
2. Clean rebuild of entire solution
3. Verified new assembly deployment

### Test Coverage Added
**File**: `tests/Architecture/PresenterRegistrationTests.cs`
- ‚úÖ Presenters resolvable from DI container
- ‚úÖ Presenters don't require views in constructors
- ‚úÖ Reflection-based service loading works

### Verification Results
- **Build Status**: Zero warnings, zero errors
- **Test Results**: 664 total, 661 passing (99.5%)
- **Runtime**: "[GridView] Successfully attached to GridPresenter"
- **DI Container**: All presenters registered and resolvable

### Architectural Impact
**Achievement**: Clean separation between DI-managed presenters and Godot-managed views
**Pattern**: Late-binding MVP with service locator bridge
**Benefit**: Compile-time enforcement of architectural boundaries

### Commits:
- 199f995: "fix: Register presenters in DI container and fix view attachment pattern"
- 478b15b: "docs: Add post-mortem and update implementation status with DI control flow"

### Post-Mortem Created
**File**: `Docs/06-PostMortems/Inbox/2025-09-16-presenter-di-registration-failure.md`
- Complete timeline and root cause analysis
- Lessons learned and prevention measures
- Documented architectural pattern evolution

### Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - READY FOR TECH LEAD REVIEW

### TD_055: Document Real Implementation Experience on Phase Completion
**Extraction Status**: NOT EXTRACTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Completed**: 2025-09-16
**Archive Note**: Created process for documenting real implementation experience after each development phase
---
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Owner**: ~~DevOps Engineer~~ ‚Üí Tech Lead
**Size**: S (1h actual)
**Priority**: Important - Knowledge preservation
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:44 (Tech Lead)
**Completed**: 2025-09-16 21:51 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 2/10 (simpler than automation)
**Markers**: [PROCESS] [DOCUMENTATION] [KNOWLEDGE-TRANSFER]

**What**: Document real implementation experience after each phase
**Why**: Manual backlog updates are forgotten, inconsistent, or incorrect

**Original Problem**:
- Developer completes Phase 2/4 but forgets to update backlog
- Backlog shows "In Progress" when work is actually blocked
- Phase completion info lost in commit messages
- Manual updates take time and break flow

**BETTER Solution Implemented**:
Instead of automating with scripts, we updated persona protocols to REQUIRE documentation of:
- What actually happened during implementation
- Problems encountered and how they were solved
- Technical debt and workarounds created
- Lessons learned for next phases

**What Was Actually Done**:
1. ‚úÖ Updated dev-engineer.md with Phase Completion Documentation Protocol
2. ‚úÖ Updated test-specialist.md with Test Discovery Documentation
3. ‚úÖ Created `Docs/02-Design/Protocols/Development/phase-completion-documentation.md`
4. ‚úÖ Added real examples showing valuable documentation vs generic updates

**Problems Encountered**:
- Initial approach was over-engineered (script automation)
  ‚Üí Pivoted to human protocol - more valuable
- Automation would capture WHAT but not WHY
  ‚Üí Human documentation captures decision context

**Technical Debt Created**:
- None - this is a process improvement with no technical debt

**Value Delivered**:
- Future debugging has context ("why does this work this way?")
- Knowledge transfer for team members
- Refactoring safety (know which workarounds are intentional)
- Better estimates from real implementation times

**Example Update Format**:
```markdown
**Phase 2 Complete** (2025-09-16 19:45):
- ‚úÖ All Phase 2 tests passing (15/15)
- ‚úÖ Command handlers implemented
- ‚è±Ô∏è Execution time: 423ms
- üìù Auto-updated by build.ps1
```

**Extraction Targets**:
- [ ] ADR needed for: Phase completion documentation protocol
- [ ] HANDBOOK update: Process patterns for documenting real implementation experience
- [ ] Test pattern: None (this is a process improvement)

### TD_052: Restrict Backlog-Assistant to Archive Operations Only
**Extraction Status**: NOT EXTRACTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Completed**: 2025-09-16
**Archive Note**: Simplified backlog-assistant agent to handle only archiving operations
---
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Owner**: ~~DevOps Engineer~~ ‚Üí Tech Lead
**Size**: S (15min actual)
**Priority**: Important - Process clarity
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:32 (Tech Lead)
**Completed**: 2025-09-16 21:56 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 1/10
**Markers**: [PROCESS] [TOOLING]

**What**: Update backlog-assistant agent to ONLY handle archive operations
**Why**: Current scope too broad, creates confusion about when to use it

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ‚úÖ Created new minimal `backlog-archiver.md` agent config
2. ‚úÖ Renamed old agent to `backlog-assistant.md.deprecated`
3. ‚úÖ Restricted to ONLY Read, Edit, MultiEdit tools
4. ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with new restricted scope
5. ‚úÖ Updated Workflow.md references

**What Was Actually Done**:
- Created ultra-minimal agent that can ONLY archive (no scoring, gaps, etc.)
- Agent explicitly states what it CANNOT do (create, edit, update, reorganize)
- Gray color to indicate limited functionality
- Clear examples showing archive is its ONLY purpose

**Technical Approach**:
- Old agent had 228 lines with complex scoring, gap detection, formatting
- New agent has 75 lines with single purpose: move completed ‚Üí archive
- Removed all strategic decision-making capabilities

**Value Delivered**:
- Crystal clear when to use agent (only for archiving)
- No confusion about agent capabilities
- Prevents accidental misuse for other backlog operations
---
**Extraction Targets**:
- [ ] ADR needed for: None (simple process change)
- [ ] HANDBOOK update: Agent scope restriction patterns
- [ ] Test pattern: None (tooling change)

### TD_049: Size-Based Backlog Archive Protocol
**Extraction Status**: NOT EXTRACTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Completed**: 2025-09-16
**Archive Note**: Created size-based archive rotation protocol to manage backlog file sizes
---
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Owner**: ~~DevOps Engineer~~ ‚Üí Tech Lead
**Size**: S (45min actual)
**Priority**: Important - Maintainability
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:29 (Tech Lead)
**Completed**: 2025-09-16 22:02 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 2/10
**Markers**: [PROCESS] [WORKFLOW]

**What**: Create size-based archive rotation for completed backlog items
**Why**: Archive already at 3814 lines, making it unwieldy

**Better Solution Implemented** (not script-based):
1. ‚úÖ Created `ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` for quick reference
2. ‚úÖ Size-based rotation at 1000 lines (not time-based)
3. ‚úÖ Updated backlog-archiver to check size and warn
4. ‚úÖ Created archive-management protocol
5. ‚úÖ Manual rotation with clear workflow

**What Was Actually Done**:
- Created searchable index showing what's in each archive
- Set 1000-line threshold (optimal for Git/search/editing)
- Archive blocks at 1000 lines until user rotates
- Clear naming: `Completed_Backlog_NNN.md`
- Protocol document in `Docs/02-Design/Protocols/Process/`

**Problems Solved**:
- Time-based archives create arbitrary splits
  ‚Üí Size-based ensures consistent, manageable files
- No way to find old items
  ‚Üí Index provides quick reference by number/date/feature
- Automation hides important decisions
  ‚Üí Manual rotation keeps user in control

**Value Delivered**:
- Archive stays under 1000 lines (currently 3814 needs splitting)
- Quick item lookup via index
- Git-friendly file sizes
- ~40 items per archive file
---
**Extraction Targets**:
- [ ] ADR needed for: Size-based vs time-based archive rotation strategies
- [ ] HANDBOOK update: Archive management patterns for documentation systems
- [ ] Test pattern: None (process/workflow change)
