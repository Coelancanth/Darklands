### TD_005: Fix Actor Movement Visual Update Bug
**Extraction Status**: FULLY EXTRACTED ✅
**Completed**: 2025-09-07 12:41
**Archive Note**: Critical visual sync bug resolved - fixed property names, presenter communication, visual position updates
---
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (Completed 2025-09-07 12:36)
**Size**: S (<2h)
**Priority**: High (Blocks VS_008)
**Markers**: [BUG-FIX] [VISUAL-SYNC] [BLOCKING]
**Created**: 2025-08-30 20:51

**What**: Fix visual position sync bug in ActorView.cs movement methods
**Why**: Core interactive functionality broken - actor doesn't move visually despite logical success

**Problem Details**:
- Click-to-move logic works perfectly (shows "Success at (1, 1): Moved")
- Actor (blue square) remains visually at position (0,0) 
- Logical position updates correctly in domain/application layers
- Visual update pipeline failing in presentation layer

**Root Cause Location**:
- **Primary**: ActorView.cs - MoveActorAsync method
- **Secondary**: ActorView.cs - MoveActorNodeDeferred method  
- **Issue**: Visual position not syncing with logical position updates

**Technical Approach**:
- Debug MoveActorAsync: Verify actor node position updates
- Check MoveActorNodeDeferred: Ensure Godot node transforms correctly
- Validate coordinate conversion: Logical grid → Visual pixel coordinates
- Test CallDeferred pipeline: Ensure thread-safe UI updates work

**Done When**:
- Actor (blue square) moves visually when clicked
- Visual position matches logical position (1,1) after move
- Console shows success AND visual movement occurs
- No regression in existing click-to-move pipeline
- All 123+ tests still pass

**Impact if Not Fixed**:
- VS_008 cannot be completed (blocks milestone)
- No visual feedback for player interactions
- Core game loop non-functional for testing
- Cannot validate MVP architecture end-to-end

**Depends On**: None - Self-contained visual bug fix

**[Dev Engineer] Completion** (2025-09-07 12:36):
- ✅ Fixed THREE root causes: property names, presenter communication, tween execution
- ✅ Visual movement now works (direct position assignment)
- ✅ VS_008 unblocked and functional

### TD_008: Godot Console Serilog Sink with Rich Output
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Owner**: Dev Engineer  
**Complexity Score**: 4/10  
**Created**: 2025-09-07 13:53
**Priority**: Important

**Problem**: Currently Views use dual logging (ILogger + GD.Print) which is redundant and inconsistent. Need proper Serilog sink that outputs to Godot console with rich formatting.

**Reference Implementation**: BlockLife project has working Godot Serilog sink that should be ported/adapted.

**Solution Approach**:
1. Create `GodotConsoleSink` implementing Serilog `ILogEventSink`
2. Add rich formatting with colors, timestamps, structured data
3. Wire into existing Serilog configuration in GameStrapper
4. Remove dual logging pattern from Views
5. Ensure compatibility with Godot Editor console output

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Single logging interface (ILogger only) across all layers
- [x] Rich console output in Godot Editor with colors/formatting  
- [x] Structured logging preserved (maintain file logging)
- [x] Performance acceptable (no frame drops)
- [x] Works in both Editor and runtime modes

**[Tech Lead] Decision** (2025-09-07 13:58):
- **APPROVED with MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- Complexity: 4/10 - Pattern exists in BlockLife
- Eliminates dual logging anti-pattern
- Improves all future debugging sessions
- ~3 hour implementation

**Implementation Notes**:
- Reference BlockLife's `src/Core/Infrastructure/Logging/` implementation
- Should integrate with existing `GameStrapper.ConfigureLogging()`
- Consider different log levels having different colors
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing log file output

**Deliverables COMPLETED**:
1. ✅ GodotConsoleSink implementation (Infrastructure/Logging/GodotConsoleSink.cs)
2. ✅ GameStrapper integration with dependency injection pattern
3. ✅ Dual logging anti-pattern eliminated from Views (ActorView, GridView, GameManager)
4. ✅ Improved ActorId readability (Actor_12345678 vs full GUID)
5. ✅ Enhanced log message clarity (movement shows from→to coordinates)

**Quality Gates**:

**Status**: COMPLETE ← IMPLEMENTED 2025-09-07 16:35 (Dev Engineer delivery)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (<4h) - ACTUAL: 3.5h
**Priority**: Critical (Core combat system foundation)  
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [PHASE-2] [COMPLETE]
**Created**: 2025-08-29 14:15
**Completed**: 2025-09-07 16:35

**✅ DELIVERED**: Priority queue-based timeline scheduler for traditional roguelike turn order

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**:
- **CombatScheduler**: List<ISchedulable> with binary search insertion (allows duplicates)
- **TimeComparer**: Deterministic ordering via TimeUnit + Guid tie-breaking  
- **ICombatSchedulerService**: Service abstraction with InMemory implementation
- **Commands**: ScheduleActorCommand, ProcessNextTurnCommand + handlers
- **Query**: GetSchedulerQuery for turn order inspection
- **DI Integration**: Registered in GameStrapper.cs

**✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA SATISFIED**:
- [x] Actors execute in correct time order (fastest first)
- [x] Unique IDs ensure deterministic tie-breaking
- [x] Time costs determine next turn scheduling  
- [x] Commands process through MediatR pipeline
- [x] 1500+ actors perform efficiently (<2s - exceeds 1000+ requirement)
- [x] 158 comprehensive unit tests pass (100% success rate)

**✅ QUALITY VALIDATION**:

### TD_009: Remove Position from Actor Domain Model [ARCHITECTURE] 
**Extraction Status**: FULLY EXTRACTED ✅

### TD_009: Remove Position from Actor Domain Model [ARCHITECTURE]
**Status**: Done (completed 2025-09-07)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (completed)
**Complexity**: 6/10 (Touches multiple layers)
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: 🔥 Critical (Blocks VS_010b - attack needs correct position lookups)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SSOT] [REFACTOR]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 18:05

**Problem Statement**:
Actor domain model contains Position property, creating duplicate state across three locations:
- Actor.Position property (domain model)
- GridStateService._actorPositions dictionary
- ActorStateService._actors (contains Actor with Position)

This violates Single Source of Truth and WILL cause synchronization bugs where actors appear in wrong positions.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Domain model pollution: Actor knows about grid positions (violates SRP)
- No clear ownership: Position data exists in multiple services
- Synchronization nightmare: Moving requires updating 3 different states

**Solution - Hybrid SSOT Architecture**:
1. **Remove Position from Actor domain model** - Actor focuses only on health/combat stats
2. **GridStateService owns positions** - Single source of truth for all position data
3. **ActorStateService owns actor properties** - Single source of truth for health/stats
4. **Create CombatQueryService** - Composes data from both services when needed

**Implementation Steps**:
- Phase 1: Remove Position property and MoveTo() method from Actor.cs
- Phase 2: Update InMemoryActorStateService to store position-less Actors
- Phase 3: Ensure GridStateService is sole authority for positions
- Phase 4: Create ICombatQueryService for composite queries
- Phase 5: Update all commands/handlers to use correct service
- Phase 6: Update presenters to query from appropriate services

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Removed Position property from Actor domain model
- ✅ Updated all factory methods to remove position parameters
- ✅ Created ICombatQueryService for composite queries  
- ✅ Updated all presenters to use appropriate services
- ✅ Updated all tests to work with new architecture
- ✅ All 249 tests now passing with clean architecture

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Actor domain model has no Position property
- ✅ GridStateService is only source for position queries
- ✅ ActorStateService is only source for health/stat queries
- ✅ All existing tests pass with refactored architecture
- ✅ No duplicate position state anywhere in codebase

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-07 18:05):
- **Approved for immediate implementation after VS_010a UI fix**
- Risk: HIGH if not fixed - will cause position desync bugs
- Pattern: Follows clean architecture separation of concerns
- Blocks: VS_010b requires correct position lookups for adjacency checks

**Result**: ✅ Static callbacks eliminated, ❌ Introduced new technical debt (static handlers)
**Post-Mortem**: Docs/06-PostMortems/Inbox/2025-09-08-ui-event-routing-failure.md
**Follow-up**: Created TD_017, TD_018 for proper architectural solution

**What**: Replace static mutable callbacks with proper event bus or MediatR notifications
**Why**: Static callbacks break testability, create hidden dependencies, and prevent parallel test execution

**Problem Statement**:
- ExecuteAttackCommandHandler uses `public static Action<>? OnActorDeath/OnActorDamaged`
- Static mutable state makes testing difficult
- Hidden coupling between handler and UI layer
- Cannot run tests in parallel due to shared state

**How**:
- Create domain events: `ActorDiedEvent`, `ActorDamagedEvent` as INotification
- Publish via MediatR: `await _mediator.Publish(new ActorDiedEvent(...))`
- Subscribe in presenters via INotificationHandler<T>
- Remove all static callback fields

**Done When**:
- Zero static mutable fields in ExecuteAttackCommandHandler
- Events published through MediatR pipeline
- Presenters receive events via handlers
- Tests can run in parallel without interference
- No regression in UI updates

**Depends On**: None

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-08 14:45):
- **APPROVED WITH HIGH PRIORITY** - Critical architectural flaw affecting testability
- Static mutable callbacks violate fundamental OOP principles
- MediatR notifications are the correct pattern (already in our pipeline)
- Implementation: Create ActorDiedEvent/ActorDamagedEvent as INotification
- Route to Dev Engineer for immediate implementation

**Strategic Questions for Review**:
1. **Scope Impact**: Do TD_020, TD_021, TD_022 need scope adjustments for enhanced requirements?
2. **Split Decision**: Should complex enhancements become separate TD items (e.g., architecture tests, cross-platform CI)?
3. **Priority Sequencing**: Which enhanced features are Phase 1 vs Phase 2 implementations?
4. **Implementation Complexity**: Are complexity scores (90/85/75) still accurate with enhancements?
5. **Resource Allocation**: Do we need additional specialist input (DevOps for CI, Test Specialist for architecture tests)?

**Done When**:
- All four enhanced ADRs reviewed for implementation impact
- TD_020, TD_021, TD_022 scope validated or adjusted
- Decision made on splitting complex enhancements into separate items
- Implementation priority and sequence confirmed
- Resource requirements validated (Dev Engineer vs multi-persona)
- Any new TD items created for deferred enhancements
- Updated complexity scores if needed

**Depends On**: Review of enhanced ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-006, ADR-011, ADR-012

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-08 22:59):
- **AUTO-APPROVED** - Critical strategic review before implementation
- Must complete before Dev Engineer starts TD_020/021/022
- Enhanced ADRs significantly more comprehensive than original versions
