**Implementation**: Removed `git add .claude/memory-bank/*.md 2>/dev/null` line from `.husky/pre-commit`, tested hook functionality, verified formatting still works correctly
**Impact**: Quality gates restored - no more --no-verify bypassing needed for legitimate commits, all pre-commit protections (formatting, commit message validation) working properly
**Lessons**: Infrastructure code must evolve with architectural changes - when TD_053/TD_054 made Memory Bank local-only, the hook became outdated and blocked workflow until fixed
**Unblocked**: Entire development team workflow - proper pre-commit enforcement without bypass requirement
**Root Cause**: Hook written before architectural change to local-only Memory Bank, demonstrating need for infrastructure review after system changes
[METADATA: infrastructure, git-hooks, memory-bank, critical-fix, workflow-blocker, devops]

**Impact**: Memory Bank is now local-only with gentle reminder at the right moment. Zero sync complexity, full developer autonomy preserved.
**Lessons**: Pre-push is the only moment that matters for context - activeContext serves AI context window, not git history
**Unblocked**: Human/AI decides what's worth recording, not automation
[METADATA: memory-bank, git-hooks, minimal-solution, elegance]

#### TD_054: Minimize Local Memory Bank to Essential Files Only ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-21
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Effort**: S (<4h)
**Outcome**: Reduced local Memory Bank to only activeContext.md, eliminated digital hoarding and outdated protocols
**Implementation**: Updated all 6 persona documents with Memory Bank Protocol section, documented new "Local-only" approach, established "Manual updates only" at pre-push with git hook reminder, all personas now understand Memory Bank is local to each clone with no sync
**Protocol Established**: Local-only Memory Bank, no sync required, pre-push reminder, manual updates only when significant context worth preserving
**Impact**: All 6 personas now have consistent understanding of simplified Memory Bank. No more references to deleted files or complex sync protocols.
**Lessons**: Buffers become stale, immediate extraction or deletion better - if valuable → formal docs NOW, if not → don't record
**Unblocked**: Memory Bank becomes truly minimal, personas have clear protocol
[METADATA: memory-bank, cleanup, persona-protocols, simplification]

#### TD_059: Multi-Branch Orchestration Intelligence ❌ REJECTED
**Rejected**: 2025-08-22
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Effort**: M (4-8h estimated)
**Reason**: Over-engineered solution with unnecessary complexity - priority scoring algorithms and orchestration intelligence were overkill for simple information display need
**Tech Lead Decision**: REJECTED - Appears to be post-hoc justification for work already done rather than planned solution to real problem
**Issues Identified**: Work should be planned BEFORE implementation, not justified after; priority scoring algorithms unnecessary for simple multi-branch status view
**Alternative**: Created simpler TD_060 for basic multi-branch status view focusing on information display rather than complex orchestration
**Lessons**: Keep solutions simple - information display needs don't require intelligent algorithms or complex orchestration systems
**Pattern Concern**: Post-implementation justification anti-pattern - work items should solve defined problems, not rationalize existing implementations

**Implementation**: Enhanced embody.ps1 to capture timestamp at start of execution using consistent $scriptStartTime throughout script, updated stash message generation to use captured timestamp, enhanced CLAUDE.md documentation with mandatory `date` command guidance, implemented auto-timestamp injection for session log entries
**Impact**: Memory Bank updates always have accurate timestamps, session log entries reflect actual work time, eliminated "future dated" or incorrect timestamps, process is completely automatic
**Lessons**: Timestamp accuracy critical for historical tracking - manual timestamp entry leads to inevitable errors, automated capture at script start ensures consistency across all operations
**Unblocked**: Reliable historical tracking, eliminated confusion about when work was actually completed, improved session log integrity for all personas
**Tech Lead Decision**: Complexity 1/10 trivial fix for real problem - classic "obvious fix" that should just be done, solves actual confusion without adding dependencies
**Technical Achievement**: Zero-friction solution making timestamp errors impossible rather than just documented
[METADATA: timestamp-accuracy, automation, memory-bank, session-logs, embody-integration, historical-tracking, devops]

#### TD_079: Simple CI Staged Test Execution ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-24
**Effort**: S (30min)
**Outcome**: Implemented fail-fast architecture tests in CI achieving 38-second savings on architecture violations with zero maintenance burden
**Implementation**: Added "Quick Tests" step that runs ./scripts/test/quick.ps1 (1.3s), full test suite only runs if quick tests pass, reused existing test categorization from TD_071 without complex mapping or caching, clear separation in GitHub Actions UI showing "Quick Tests" and "Full Tests" steps
**Impact**: CI fails in 1.3s for architecture violations (vs previous 39s full suite), saves ~38 seconds on architecture violations, zero maintenance burden using existing scripts, clear PR workflow visibility
**Lessons**: Simple solutions beat complex ones - reusing TD_071 test categorization without fragile file mapping or cache invalidation provides immediate value with minimal risk
**Unblocked**: Fast CI feedback without complexity, eliminated 97% of wasted CI time on architecture violations, foundation for additional staged execution patterns

#### TD_077: Incremental Test Runner for 95% Faster Feedback ❌ REJECTED
**Rejected**: 2025-08-24 02:21
**Reason**: Over-engineered solution with complexity 7/10 - fragile file mapping, cache invalidation complexity, and risk of missing affected tests outweighed 30s CI savings benefit
**Alternative**: Implemented simpler TD_071 (test categorization) + TD_079 (staged CI execution) achieving same goal with 2/10 complexity instead
**Tech Lead Analysis**: Local feedback already fast with quick.ps1 (1.3s), file-to-test mapping breaks easily with refactoring, cache bugs notoriously hard to debug, false negatives worse than 30s wait time
**Key Issues**: File mapping fragility, cache invalidation debugging complexity, maintenance burden not justified, risk of missing tests in incremental approach
**Lessons**: Sometimes "95% faster" isn't worth the engineering complexity - simpler solutions (test categorization) achieve same user value without operational risk

#### BR_014: Visual Tier Indicators Not Displaying Despite Fixed Notification Layer ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-26
**Effort**: S (2h investigation + fix)
**Outcome**: Resolved root cause - blocks stayed at tier 1 because merge was not unlocked by default
**Root Cause**: New players start with MaxUnlockedTier = 1 (match-only mode), tier visual indicators only show for tier > 1, merge had to be purchased via F8 key
**Solution**: Fixed tier visualization code conditional bug and enabled merge by default (MaxUnlockedTier = 2)
**Testing**: Confirmed visualization system works correctly when blocks actually have tier > 1
**Lessons**: Visual feedback systems must account for game state - tier indicators don't display if no higher tiers exist
**Unblocked**: Complete merge system visual feedback, players can now see tier progression

**Completed**: 2025-08-27 (Resolved: 2025-08-26 23:41)
**Effort**: S (40 min actual vs 2-3h estimated)
**Outcome**: Resolved critical test failure blocking PR merge - fixed incorrect test setup in PurchaseMergeUnlockCommandHandler
**Root Cause Analysis**: PlayerState.CreateNew() defaulted MaxUnlockedTier = 2 (for testing convenience) but this broke purchase validation logic - player already had T2 unlocked so purchase validation failed appropriately but tests expected success
**Fix Applied**: Changed default MaxUnlockedTier from 2 to 1 in PlayerState, fixed SetupTestPlayerWithMoneyAndUnlockedTier helper to use proper UpdatePlayer() call with version tracking, enabled 2 previously skipped tests
**Result**: All 9 PurchaseMergeUnlockCommandHandler tests now pass, PR unblocked for merge
**Lessons**: Test data setup must reflect realistic game state - convenience defaults that violate business rules lead to confusing test failures that mask real issues

**Proposed Size**: M (4-6h)
**Reason**: Pattern executors already have comprehensive logging (verified with code inspection). Visual debugging covered by TD_088. Mixing unrelated concerns (logging vs telemetry).
**Alternative**: Existing logging is sufficient. If metrics needed later, create focused 1-2h TD for counters only.
[RESURRECT-IF: Production shows specific observability gaps that current logging doesn't cover]

#### TD_086: Implement Property-Based Testing for Pattern Recognition ❌ REJECTED  
**Rejected**: 2025-08-27 by Tech Lead
**Proposed Size**: L (8-12h)
**Reason**: MatchPatternPropertyTests.cs already exists with comprehensive FsCheck tests. This is duplicate/redundant work proposing what we already have.
**Alternative**: Continue using existing property-based tests which already validate pattern recognition invariants.
[RESURRECT-IF: Never - we already have this]

#### TD_087: Performance Optimization for Large Grid Pattern Recognition ❌ REJECTED
**Rejected**: 2025-08-27 by Tech Lead  
**Proposed Size**: L (8-12h)
**Reason**: Classic premature optimization. Current grid is 10x10, not 100x100. No evidence of performance problems. "May lag" = theoretical problem, not real.
**Alternative**: Keep current O(n²) algorithm which works fine for actual grid sizes. Profile first if issues arise.
[RESURRECT-IF: Grid size increases beyond 20x20 AND profiling shows pattern recognition as bottleneck]

#### VS_005: User-Facing Merge Unlock UI ❌ REJECTED
**Rejected**: 2025-08-27 13:00
**Proposed Size**: M (4-6h)
**Reason**: User decided to remove all UI-related debug code instead - F8 debug panel completely removed to prevent bugs
**Alternative**: Debug functionality preserved through keyboard shortcuts (Space/Tab/I keys), merge unlocks remain backend-only for now
**Background**: Backend purchase system fully working (VS_003B-3), but Product Owner had initially approved creating accessible UI for players to purchase merge pattern unlocks without debug keys
**Decision Context**: User preference for keyboard shortcuts over UI complexity, simplified debug approach without visual panels
