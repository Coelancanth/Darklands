# Post-Mortem: BR_007 - Concurrent Collection Access Error

**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Author**: Debugger Expert  
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: System Stability  
**Time to Resolution**: 1.5 hours  

## Executive Summary

A concurrent collection modification error in the actor display system caused application crashes when multiple actors were created simultaneously. The root cause was using non-thread-safe `Dictionary<>` collections while accessing them from async `Task.Run()` operations. Fixed by replacing with `ConcurrentDictionary<>`.

## Timeline

- **2025-09-12 11:47**: BR_007 created and assigned to Test Specialist
- **2025-09-12 12:00**: Escalated to Debugger Expert for investigation
- **2025-09-12 12:15**: Root cause identified in ActorView.cs
- **2025-09-12 12:30**: Fix implemented with ConcurrentDictionary
- **2025-09-12 12:45**: Regression tests created and passing
- **2025-09-12 12:47**: Fix deployed and verified

## What Went Wrong

### The Bug
```
[ERR] [Gameplay] Error displaying actor Actor_813e2abc: 
Operations that change non-concurrent collections must have exclusive access. 
A concurrent update was performed on this collection and corrupted its state.
```

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

1. **Why did the error occur?**  
   The `_actorNodes` dictionary in ActorView.cs was being modified concurrently.

2. **Why was it being modified concurrently?**  
   ActorPresenter.Initialize() was using `Task.Run()` to create multiple actors asynchronously.

3. **Why was this a problem?**  
   The dictionary was a regular `Dictionary<>`, not thread-safe for concurrent access.

4. **Why wasn't thread safety considered?**  
   The developer assumed CallDeferred would handle all thread safety, but it only protects Godot node operations, not C# collection access.

5. **Why did this assumption exist?**  
   Incomplete understanding of the boundary between Godot's thread safety mechanisms and C#'s collection thread safety requirements.

## Technical Details

### The Problematic Pattern

```csharp
// ActorPresenter.cs (lines 81-83)
_ = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    await View.DisplayActorAsync(playerId, position, ActorType.Player);
});

// ActorView.cs (line 84) - UNSAFE READ
if (_actorNodes.TryGetValue(actorId, out var existingNode))

// ActorView.cs (line 139) - UNSAFE WRITE  
_actorNodes[creationData.ActorId] = creationData.ActorNode;
```

### Race Condition Scenario

1. Thread A starts reading `_actorNodes` for Actor1
2. Thread B starts modifying `_actorNodes` for Actor2
3. Dictionary's internal state becomes corrupted
4. Exception thrown: "Operations that change non-concurrent collections..."

## The Fix

### Changes Made

1. **Replaced unsafe collections**:
```csharp
// BEFORE
private readonly Dictionary<ActorId, ColorRect> _actorNodes = new();

// AFTER  
private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<ActorId, ColorRect> _actorNodes = new();
```

2. **Updated all operations to thread-safe methods**:
```csharp
// BEFORE
_actorNodes.Remove(actorId);

// AFTER
_actorNodes.TryRemove(actorId, out _);
```

3. **Added comprehensive regression tests** with scenarios for:
   - Concurrent creation (100 actors × 10 iterations)
   - Concurrent removal
   - Mixed operations (200 random operations)
   - Stress testing (20 threads × 100 operations)

## Impact Analysis

### What Was Affected
- Actor creation during game initialization
- Dynamic actor spawning during gameplay
- Potential for complete application crash
- Data corruption in actor display state

### What Was NOT Affected
- Game logic (Phase 1-3)
- Save/load functionality
- Non-concurrent actor operations

## Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways

1. **Thread Safety Boundaries**: CallDeferred only protects Godot node operations, not C# collection operations. Each layer has its own thread safety requirements.

2. **Async Patterns in Game Dev**: Using `Task.Run()` in game initialization can introduce subtle race conditions. Consider if async is truly needed for turn-based games.

3. **Collection Choice Matters**: When any possibility of concurrent access exists, default to thread-safe collections (`ConcurrentDictionary`, `ConcurrentBag`, etc.).

4. **Testing Gap**: Our existing tests didn't catch this because they weren't stressing concurrent operations. Added ThreadSafety test category.

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions Taken

1. ✅ Replaced all shared collections in ActorView with thread-safe alternatives
2. ✅ Created regression test suite for concurrent operations
3. ✅ Added ThreadSafety test category for future use

### Recommended Future Actions

1. **Code Review Checklist**: Add "Check for thread-safe collections in async contexts" to review criteria

2. **Architecture Pattern**: Consider if Phase 4 (Presentation) needs async at all for turn-based gameplay

3. **Static Analysis**: Configure analyzer to warn when regular Dictionary used with Task.Run

4. **Documentation**: Update HANDBOOK.md with thread safety patterns for Godot integration

## Similar Vulnerabilities to Check

Based on this pattern, we should audit:

1. **GridView.cs**: Check if `_tileNodes` dictionary has similar issues
2. **HealthView.cs**: Verify `_healthBars` collection thread safety  
3. **Any Presenter using Task.Run**: Review all async initialization patterns

## Metrics

- **Detection Time**: 13 minutes (11:47 → 12:00)
- **Investigation Time**: 15 minutes
- **Fix Implementation**: 15 minutes  
- **Test Creation**: 15 minutes
- **Verification**: 2 minutes
- **Total Resolution**: 1.5 hours

## Action Items

- [ ] Extract thread safety patterns to HANDBOOK.md
- [ ] Review all View classes for similar collection issues
- [ ] Consider removing unnecessary async from Presenters
- [ ] Add ThreadSafety tests for other concurrent scenarios

## Conclusion

This bug revealed a systemic misunderstanding about thread safety boundaries between Godot and C#. While the fix was simple (ConcurrentDictionary), the lesson is valuable: **always verify thread safety at every layer of the stack**, don't assume one layer's protections extend to another.

The rapid resolution (1.5 hours) was due to clear error messages and good logging. Investment in diagnostic infrastructure pays off during critical bugs.
