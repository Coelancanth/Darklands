# Post-Mortem: Presenter DI Registration Failure

**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Severity**: High (Prevented application startup)
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Author**: Dev Engineer

## Summary
GameStrapper failed to initialize presenters because they required view interfaces in their constructors, but views cannot be registered in DI as they're created by Godot's scene system.

## Timeline of Events

### 18:00 - Initial Error Reported
User reported error: "IGridPresenter not registered in GameStrapper"

### 18:05 - Initial Investigation
- Confirmed presenters were not being registered in DI container
- Found ServiceConfiguration class existed but wasn't being called

### 18:10 - First Fix Attempt
- Added ConfigurePresentationServices call to GameStrapper using reflection
- This registered the presenters but exposed a deeper issue

### 18:15 - Root Cause Discovery
- Presenters required IGridView, IActorView, IAttackView in constructors
- Views are Godot nodes created by scene system, not DI
- Fundamental architectural mismatch between MVP pattern and DI container

### 18:20 - Solution Implementation
- Updated PresenterBase to support late-binding via AttachView
- Removed view dependencies from all presenter constructors
- Modified GameManager to resolve presenters from DI then attach views

### 18:21 - Validation
- Build successful, 661/664 tests passing
- Committed changes

### 18:22 - Issue Persists
- Error still occurring in Godot runtime
- Old compiled assembly still being loaded

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**Architectural mismatch**: Presenters were designed with constructor injection of views, but views are framework-specific objects (Godot nodes) that cannot be created by DI container.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Incomplete MVP pattern implementation**: Original design didn't account for late-binding of views
2. **Assembly caching**: Godot may be loading cached version of Presentation.dll
3. **Build order issue**: Godot project might not be rebuilding Presentation assembly

## What Went Wrong

### Design Issues
- Presenter constructors required view interfaces directly
- No mechanism for late-binding views to presenters
- ServiceConfiguration defined but never invoked

### Implementation Issues
- GameStrapper didn't load presentation services
- GameManager manually created presenters instead of using DI
- No clear separation between DI-managed and Godot-managed objects

## What Went Right

### Good Architecture
- Clean separation in 4-project structure helped isolate issue
- ServiceConfiguration was already defined, just not wired
- Interfaces were properly defined for all presenters

### Quick Resolution
- Problem identified quickly through error messages
- Solution implemented following established patterns
- Tests validated the fix

## Fixes Applied

### Code Changes
1. **GameStrapper.cs**: Added ConfigurePresentationServices method using reflection
2. **PresenterBase.cs**: Added support for parameterless constructor and AttachView method
3. **All Presenters**: Removed view parameters from constructors
4. **GameManager.cs**: Updated to resolve presenters from DI container

### Pattern Changes
- Established late-binding pattern for MVP in Godot context
- Views attach to presenters, not vice versa
- Clear separation: DI manages presenters, Godot manages views

## Lessons Learned

### Technical
1. **Framework constraints matter**: DI patterns must accommodate framework-specific object creation
2. **Late-binding is essential**: When mixing managed and unmanaged object lifecycles
3. **Assembly loading**: Need to ensure Godot rebuilds and reloads assemblies

### Process
1. **Test integration points**: Should have integration test for DI + Godot
2. **Document patterns**: MVP pattern implementation should be documented
3. **Validate runtime**: Build passing doesn't mean runtime works

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions
1. Clean and rebuild entire solution including Godot project
2. Verify Presentation.dll is updated in Godot's .mono directory
3. Add integration test for presenter resolution

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Document MVP pattern**: Create clear guide for presenter-view binding
2. **Add runtime validation**: Check presenter registration on startup
3. **Build script enhancement**: Ensure Godot assemblies are refreshed
4. **Integration tests**: Add tests that validate DI container in Godot context

## Outstanding Issues

### Assembly Loading
- Need to verify Godot is loading updated Presentation.dll
- May need to clear Godot's .mono/temp directory
- Consider adding version check to assemblies

### Testing Gap
- No integration test covers DI container + Godot initialization
- Should add startup smoke test

## Action Items

- [ ] Clear Godot .mono/temp directory and rebuild
- [ ] Add integration test for presenter registration
- [ ] Document MVP pattern in HANDBOOK.md
- [ ] Add assembly version logging to startup
- [ ] Create presenter registration validation on startup

## Severity Assessment

**Why High Severity:**
- Prevented application from starting
- Blocked all development and testing
- Required architectural changes to fix

**Why Not Critical:**
- No data loss
- No production impact (development phase)
- Fix was straightforward once understood
