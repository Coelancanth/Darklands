# Phase Completion Documentation Protocol

## Purpose
Capture the REAL implementation experience after each phase to preserve valuable knowledge about decisions, problems, and workarounds that would otherwise be lost in commit messages.

## Core Principle
**Document the journey, not just the destination.** Future developers need to understand WHY things work the way they do, not just that tests pass.

## üìù Documentation Format

### For Dev Engineer (Implementation)

After completing each phase, add to the backlog VS/TD item:

```markdown
**Phase X Complete** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM):
‚úÖ Tests: N/N passing (execution time: XXXms)

**What I Actually Did**:
- [Key implementation decisions made]
- [Patterns followed or adapted]
- [Deviations from original plan and why]

**Problems Encountered**:
- [Problem 1]: [How I solved it]
- [Problem 2]: [Workaround created]
- [Problem 3]: [Why I couldn't solve it yet]

**Technical Debt Created**:
- [Shortcuts taken and justification]
- [What should be refactored later]
- [Known limitations of current approach]

**Lessons for Next Phase**:
- [Integration points to be careful with]
- [Assumptions made that might need revision]
- [Performance considerations discovered]
```

### For Test Specialist (Validation)

When validating phase completion:

```markdown
**Phase X Test Validation** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM):
‚úÖ Tests: N/N passing (coverage: XX%)

**Test Discoveries**:
- [Edge cases that weren't obvious]
- [Performance characteristics observed]
- [Flaky patterns that might emerge]

**Test Debt Identified**:
- [Missing scenarios we should add]
- [Integration tests needed later]
- [Property tests that would help]

**Warnings for Integration**:
- [Brittle points in the implementation]
- [Race conditions to watch for]
- [Resource cleanup concerns]
```

### For Debugger Expert (Investigation)

When fixing issues found during phase work:

```markdown
**Phase X Debug Session** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM):
üêõ Issue: [What broke]

**Root Cause**:
- [Why it happened]
- [Why tests didn't catch it]

**Fix Applied**:
- [What was changed]
- [Why this fixes it]
- [Side effects to watch]

**Prevention**:
- [Test that now catches this]
- [Pattern to avoid in future]
```

## üéØ What Makes Good Documentation

### ‚úÖ GOOD Documentation Examples

```markdown
**Problems Encountered**:
- SortedSet was allowing duplicate f-scores in pathfinding
  ‚Üí Added node ID to comparison for deterministic tie-breaking
  ‚Üí This means path order is now dependent on node creation order
```

```markdown
**Technical Debt Created**:
- Hard-coded Manhattan distance heuristic - works for grid but won't for hex
- No path caching - recalculates even for identical requests
- Using O(n¬≤) algorithm for closest enemy - fine for <10 enemies, will bog down
```

### ‚ùå BAD Documentation Examples

```markdown
**What I Did**:
- Implemented the feature ‚Üê Too vague
- Followed the spec ‚Üê No insight
- Made it work ‚Üê Zero value
```

```markdown
**Problems Encountered**:
- Had some issues but fixed them ‚Üê What issues? How?
- Tests were failing initially ‚Üê Why? What was wrong?
```

## üîÑ When to Document

1. **IMMEDIATELY after phase completion** - While details are fresh
2. **BEFORE moving to next phase** - Context switch loses information
3. **EVEN IF "nothing went wrong"** - Document what went RIGHT and why

## üí° Value of This Documentation

### For Future Debugging
- "Why does this use integer math?" ‚Üí Check Phase 1 notes
- "Why this specific workaround?" ‚Üí See Problems Encountered
- "Can I refactor this safely?" ‚Üí Review Technical Debt notes

### For Estimates
- Similar feature? Check how long phases actually took
- Same complexity? See what problems arose
- Pattern match? Learn from previous solutions

### For Knowledge Transfer
- New team member can understand decision history
- Architectural decisions have context
- Workarounds are documented, not mysterious

### For Refactoring
- Know which workarounds are intentional vs accidental
- Understand dependencies between phases
- See what was "temporary" and why

## üìã Checklist for Each Phase

Dev Engineer must update their checklist:
```bash
‚ñ° Tests passing
‚ñ° Code committed with phase marker
‚ñ° BACKLOG UPDATED with real implementation notes ‚Üê NEW!
‚ñ° Problems and workarounds documented ‚Üê NEW!
‚ñ° Technical debt noted for future ‚Üê NEW!
```

## üö® Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Copy-pasting generic updates** - Each phase is unique
2. **Writing after multiple phases** - Details get lost
3. **Hiding problems** - Problems are learning opportunities
4. **Theoretical improvements** - Only document what you DID
5. **Blaming tools/languages** - Focus on solutions, not complaints

## Example: Real Phase Documentation

```markdown
### VS_014: A* Pathfinding Foundation

**Phase 1 Complete** (2025-09-17 14:30):
‚úÖ Tests: 12/12 passing (87ms)

**What I Actually Did**:
- Started with float-based A* from tutorial, had to convert everything to integers
- Multiplied all costs by 100 to maintain precision without floats (ADR-004)
- Used SortedSet<PathNode> but had duplicate f-score issue
- PathNode as record with (Cost, Position, Parent) - immutable for safety

**Problems Encountered**:
- Diagonal cost (‚àö2 ‚âà 1.414) needed integer representation
  ‚Üí Used 141/100 ratio, close enough for pathfinding
- SortedSet comparison only used f-score, causing non-deterministic paths
  ‚Üí Added secondary sort by node ID for deterministic tie-breaking
- Infinite loop when start == goal
  ‚Üí Added early exit check before main loop

**Technical Debt Created**:
- Heuristic function hard-coded as Manhattan distance (TD for later)
- No path caching - every request recalculates (intentional for Phase 1)
- MaxPathLength not enforced yet - paths could be very long

**Lessons for Phase 2**:
- Command handler needs MaxPathLength validation
- Consider path request batching for multiple actors
- Watch for diagonal movement through corners (needs wall checking)
```

This documentation is worth 10x more than "Phase 1 complete, all tests passing."
