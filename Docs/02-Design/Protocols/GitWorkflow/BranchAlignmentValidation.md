# Branch Alignment Validation Protocol (TD_058)

**Document Type**: Technical Design Protocol  
**Created**: 2025-08-22  
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Implemented** (2025-08-22)  
**Related Work**: TD_057 (Critical Warning Enforcement), BranchAndCommitDecisionProtocols.md

## üéØ Purpose

Define intelligent pre-commit validation that ensures branch context aligns with commit content, preventing semantic workflow misalignments that lead to messy git history and confused pull requests.

## üö® Problem Statement

**Current Gap**: Existing hooks validate atomic commits and prevent main branch pushes, but don't catch semantic misalignments:

### Examples of Undetected Misalignments
```bash
# Problem 1: Wrong work item on branch
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "feat(TD_042): consolidate archive files"
‚ùå Issue: Technical debt work on feature branch

# Problem 2: Work item drift within session  
Branch: tech/TD_042-archives
Commit: "fix(BR_013): resolve memory leak in renderer"
‚ùå Issue: Bug fix on technical debt branch

# Problem 3: Type misalignment
Branch: fix/BR_012-login-bug
Commit: "feat(VS_004): add inventory system"
‚ùå Issue: Feature work on bug fix branch
```

**Root Cause**: No semantic validation of branch purpose vs. commit content at decision time.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

### Design Philosophy
- **Left-shift validation** - Catch misalignments at commit time (cheaper than PR/merge time)
- **Educational over blocking** - Guide personas with clear explanations
- **Progressive intelligence** - Start simple, add sophistication over time
- **Non-disruptive** - Enhance existing pre-commit hook without breaking workflow

### Validation Layers

#### Layer 1: Work Item Alignment (Core)
```bash
# Extract work items from branch and commit
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "feat(VS_003): add user login form"
‚úÖ Alignment: Both reference VS_003

Branch: tech/TD_042-archives  
Commit: "feat(VS_004): add inventory system"
‚ùå Misalignment: TD branch, VS commit
```

#### Layer 2: Work Type Validation (Enhanced)
```bash
# Validate branch type vs commit type consistency
Branch Type: feat/ ‚Üí Expected: feat, test, docs
Branch Type: tech/ ‚Üí Expected: tech, refactor, test, docs  
Branch Type: fix/  ‚Üí Expected: fix, test, docs
```

#### Layer 3: Main Branch Detection (Backup)
```bash
# Additional main branch warning (complements pre-push blocking)
Branch: main
Any Commit: Warn about upcoming pre-push block
```

## üìã Implementation Specification

### Phase 1: Basic Pattern Matching (Immediate)

**File**: `.husky/pre-commit` (enhancement to existing hook)

**Core Logic**:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Existing atomic commit guidance
echo "üí° AI Persona Reminder: Ensure Atomic Commits"
echo "   ‚úì This commit does exactly ONE logical thing"
echo "   ‚úì All staged files relate to the same change"  
echo "   ‚úì Could be described in a single sentence"
echo "   ‚úì Tests updated for this specific change only"
echo ""

# NEW: Branch Alignment Intelligence
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
commit_msg_file="$1"

# Skip validation if no commit message file (edge cases)
if [ -z "$commit_msg_file" ] || [ ! -f "$commit_msg_file" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

commit_msg=$(cat "$commit_msg_file")

# Extract work items using regex
branch_item=$(echo "$current_branch" | grep -o '[A-Z]\+_[0-9]\+' | head -1 || echo "")
commit_items=$(echo "$commit_msg" | grep -o '[A-Z]\+_[0-9]\+' || echo "")

# Branch alignment validation
if [ -n "$branch_item" ] && [ -n "$commit_items" ]; then
    # Check if any commit work item matches branch work item
    alignment_found=false
    for commit_item in $commit_items; do
        if [ "$commit_item" = "$branch_item" ]; then
            alignment_found=true
            break
        fi
    done
    
    if [ "$alignment_found" = false ]; then
        echo "ü§î Branch Alignment Check:"
        echo "   Branch context: $branch_item"
        echo "   Commit mentions: $(echo $commit_items | tr '\n' ' ')"
        echo "   üí° Consider: Are you on the right branch for this work?"
        echo "   üìã Expected: Commit should relate to $branch_item"
        echo ""
    fi
fi

# Work type alignment (basic)
branch_type=$(echo "$current_branch" | cut -d'/' -f1)
commit_type=$(echo "$commit_msg" | grep -o '^[a-z]\+' | head -1 || echo "")

case "$branch_type" in
    "feat")
        if [ -n "$commit_type" ] && ! echo "$commit_type" | grep -E '^(feat|test|docs)$' >/dev/null; then
            echo "üîÑ Work Type Check:"
            echo "   Feature branch but '$commit_type' commit type"
            echo "   üí° Expected: feat, test, or docs commits on feature branches"
            echo ""
        fi
        ;;
    "tech"|"refactor")
        if [ -n "$commit_type" ] && ! echo "$commit_type" | grep -E '^(tech|refactor|test|docs)$' >/dev/null; then
            echo "üîÑ Work Type Check:"
            echo "   Tech debt branch but '$commit_type' commit type"
            echo "   üí° Expected: tech, refactor, test, or docs commits"
            echo ""
        fi
        ;;
    "fix"|"hotfix")
        if [ -n "$commit_type" ] && ! echo "$commit_type" | grep -E '^(fix|test|docs)$' >/dev/null; then
            echo "üîÑ Work Type Check:"
            echo "   Bug fix branch but '$commit_type' commit type"
            echo "   üí° Expected: fix, test, or docs commits"
            echo ""
        fi
        ;;
esac

# Main branch warning (backup to pre-push enforcement)
if [ "$current_branch" = "main" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  MAIN BRANCH DETECTED"
    echo "   Pre-push hook will block this push"
    echo "   üí° Consider: git checkout -b feat/your-feature"
    echo ""
fi

# Always allow commit to proceed (educational, not blocking)
exit 0
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence (Future)

**Advanced Pattern Recognition**:
```bash
# Multi-work item detection
# Cross-reference with Memory Bank active context
# Persona-specific validation rules
# Historical pattern learning
```

**Memory Bank Integration**:
```bash
# Read .claude/memory-bank/activeContext.md
# Validate branch aligns with documented current work
# Provide context-aware recommendations
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Perfect Alignment
```bash
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "feat(VS_003): add user login form validation"
Expected: No warnings (perfect alignment)
```

### Test Case 2: Work Item Misalignment  
```bash
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "tech(TD_042): consolidate archive utilities"
Expected: Branch alignment warning with guidance
```

### Test Case 3: Work Type Misalignment
```bash
Branch: fix/BR_012-login-bug
Commit: "feat(VS_004): add new inventory feature"
Expected: Work type warning + work item warning
```

### Test Case 4: Main Branch Detection
```bash
Branch: main
Commit: "feat(VS_003): add authentication"
Expected: Main branch warning about pre-push block
```

### Test Case 5: Quick Fix Tolerance
```bash
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "docs: fix typo in authentication guide"
Expected: No warnings (docs commits acceptable on any branch)
```

### Test Case 6: Multi-Item Commit (Valid)
```bash
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "feat(VS_003): integrate with existing VS_001 block system"
Expected: No warnings (primary item VS_003 matches branch)
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Immediate Effectiveness
- **Misalignment Detection Rate**: % of semantic mismatches caught
- **False Positive Rate**: % of valid commits flagged incorrectly (<10% target)
- **Educational Value**: Feedback quality and actionability
- **Workflow Disruption**: Zero blocking, minimal noise

### Long-term Impact
- **Git History Quality**: Reduced cross-contamination between work items
- **PR Clarity**: Cleaner, more focused pull requests
- **Persona Education**: Improved workflow discipline over time
- **Review Efficiency**: Faster PR reviews due to better organization

## üîÑ Edge Cases & Handling

### Valid Multi-Item Scenarios
```bash
# Acceptable: Primary work item with integration
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "feat(VS_003): integrate authentication with VS_001 block system"
Validation: Primary item (VS_003) matches branch ‚úÖ

# Acceptable: Documentation spans multiple items
Branch: any
Commit: "docs: update VS_003 and TD_042 implementation notes"
Validation: docs commits bypass work item validation ‚úÖ
```

### Exception Handling
```bash
# Missing work items in branch name
Branch: feat/user-authentication (no VS_XXX)
Validation: Skip work item validation, only check work type

# Missing work items in commit
Commit: "fix: resolve authentication bug" (no work item)
Validation: Check work type alignment only

# Emergency/hotfix scenarios
Branch: hotfix/critical-security-fix
Validation: Relaxed rules for hotfix branches
```

### False Positive Mitigation
```bash
# Test commits during development
Commit: "test(VS_003): add unit tests for authentication"
Validation: test commits acceptable on any branch type

# Documentation updates
Commit: "docs(VS_003): update authentication API docs"
Validation: docs commits bypass strict alignment rules

# Quick fixes during feature work
Branch: feat/VS_003-authentication
Commit: "fix: resolve typo in VS_003 login form"
Validation: fix commits acceptable when aligned with branch work item
```
