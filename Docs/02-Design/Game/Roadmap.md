# Darklands Development Roadmap

**Purpose**: Sequence the complete [Vision.md](Vision.md) into actionable vertical slices with clear dependencies and milestones.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04 00:10 (VS_018 L-Shapes Complete)
**Status**: Phase 1 In Progress (VS_001 Health ‚úÖ, VS_005 Grid/FOV ‚úÖ, VS_006 Movement ‚úÖ, VS_008 Inventory ‚úÖ, VS_009 Items ‚úÖ, VS_018 L-Shapes ‚úÖ complete)

---

## üìä Overview: Vision to Shippable Game

**Vision**: Darklands (1992) spiritual successor with time-unit combat, skill progression, and emergent narrative

**Roadmap Philosophy**:
1. **Prove the core is fun first** - Time-unit combat must create tactical depth
2. **Incremental complexity** - Add systems only when foundation is solid
3. **Shippable at every phase** - Each phase delivers playable value
4. **Learn before scaling** - Small vertical slices reveal design problems early

---

## üéØ Four Development Phases

```
Phase 1: Combat Core (3-6 months)
   ‚Üì Prove: Time-unit combat creates tactical decisions

Phase 2: Itemization & Depth (3-4 months)
   ‚Üì Prove: Build variety creates replayability

Phase 3: Strategic Layer (4-6 months)
   ‚Üì Prove: Macro/micro loop integration works

Phase 4: Emergent Narrative (3-4 months)
   ‚Üì Prove: Origins + events create memorable stories

= 13-20 months to first complete game
```

---

## üî• Phase 1: Combat Core (CURRENT FOCUS)

**Goal**: Prove tactical positioning + time-unit combat creates deep decisions

**Revised Approach** (Based on Game Designer feedback):
1. **Positioning First** - Grid + FOV creates tactical foundation (cover, line-of-sight, terrain)
2. **Simple Turn-Based** - Validate positioning mechanics with dummy enemy testing
3. **Add Time Complexity** - Layer time-unit queue on proven positioning system
4. **Add Progression** - Proficiency system rewards mastery

**Success Criteria**:
- Positioning creates meaningful decisions (smoke cover, flanking, range control)
- FOV feels roguelike (exploration, fog of war, vision-based tactics)
- Time-unit layer adds depth without overwhelming complexity
- Proficiency improvement is visible and rewarding (hour 1 vs. hour 10)
- "One more fight" addiction emerges from testing

**Shippable Deliverable**:
- Grid-based arena (30x30 with walls, floors, smoke terrain)
- FOV with fog of war (libtcod-style shadowcasting via GoRogue)
- Turn-based then time-unit combat (incremental complexity)
- 5 sequential encounters with proficiency progression

### VS_005: Grid, FOV & Terrain System ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: Complete (2025-10-01) | **Size**: M (1 day, all 4 phases) | **Tests**: 189 passing
**Owner**: Dev Engineer

**Delivered**: 30√ó30 grid with custom shadowcasting FOV (no external dependencies), terrain types (wall/floor/smoke), fog of war system, event-driven architecture with `ActorMovedEvent` + `FOVCalculatedEvent`, ColorRect rendering

**Architecture**: Zero Godot dependencies in Core, pure functional domain logic, ServiceLocator only in `_Ready()`

**Archive**: [Completed_Backlog_2025-10_Part1.md](../../07-Archive/Completed_Backlog_2025-10_Part1.md#vs_005-grid-fov--terrain-system) (lines 541-739)

---

### VS_006: Interactive Movement System ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: Complete (2025-10-01) | **Size**: L (1.5 days, all 4 phases) | **Tests**: 215 passing
**Owner**: Dev Engineer

**Delivered**: A* pathfinding (8-directional, Chebyshev heuristic), hover-based path preview, click-to-move with Tween animation, right-click cancellation (CancellationToken pattern), fog of war integration, ILogger refactoring from LoggingService

**Architecture**: Pathfinding service in Infrastructure, command handlers use async/await, ServiceLocator only in `_Ready()`

**Archive**: [Completed_Backlog_2025-10_Part1.md](../../07-Archive/Completed_Backlog_2025-10_Part1.md#vs_006-interactive-movement-system) (lines 740+)

---

### VS_007: Time-Unit Turn Queue System ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: Complete (2025-10-04) | **Size**: L (3 days, all 4 phases) | **Tests**: 359 passing (49 new)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer

**Delivered**: Time-unit combat system with natural exploration/combat mode detection via turn queue size, FOV-based symmetric enter/exit transitions, movement costs (10 units/move), production-ready logging with Gruvbox semantic highlighting

**What Was Built**:
- **Phase 1 (Domain)**: `TimeUnits` value object, `TurnQueue` aggregate with priority queue + player-first tie-breaking, `ScheduledActor` record
- **Phase 2 (Application)**: `ScheduleActorCommand`, `RemoveActorFromQueueCommand`, `IsInCombatQuery`, `IsActorScheduledQuery`, `EnemyDetectionEventHandler` (FOV‚Üíschedule enemies), `CombatEndDetectionEventHandler` (FOV cleared‚Üíexit combat)
- **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)**: `InMemoryTurnQueueRepository`, `PlayerContext` service, DI registration in GameStrapper
- **Phase 4 (Presentation)**: Input routing (combat=single-step, exploration=auto-path), test scene with player/enemies, bug fixes (async race conditions, path preview)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Turn queue size = combat state (no separate state machine)
- Relative time model (resets to 0 per combat session)
- Player permanently in queue (never fully removed)
- FOV events drive both combat enter AND exit (symmetric pattern)
- Movement costs: 10 units in combat, instant in exploration
- Player-centric FOV only (enemies don't detect player‚Äîdeferred to VS_011)

**Example Scenario** (Exploration ‚Üí Combat ‚Üí Reinforcement ‚Üí Victory):
```
1. Player clicks distant tile ‚Üí auto-path starts (exploration mode, time=N/A)
2. Step 3: Goblin appears in FOV ‚Üí auto-path cancelled (combat starts, time=0)
   Queue: [Player@0, Goblin@0] ‚Üí Player acts first (tie-breaking)
3. Player moves 1 step (costs 100) ‚Üí Player@100, Goblin@0
4. Goblin attacks (costs 150) ‚Üí Goblin@150, Player@100
5. Player moves ‚Üí Orc appears in FOV (reinforcement!)
   Queue: [Orc@100, Player@200, Goblin@150] ‚Üí Orc acts next (just appeared)
6. Orc attacks (costs 150) ‚Üí Orc@250
7. Player defeats Goblin ‚Üí removed from queue
8. Player defeats Orc ‚Üí queue=[Player] ‚Üí combat ends (time resets)
9. Next click resumes auto-path (exploration mode)
```

**Done When**: Scenario above works end-to-end. Zero changes to existing handlers.

---

### VS_011: Enemy AI & Vision System üîÆ **FUTURE**

**Status**: Planned (depends on VS_007)
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (for breakdown)
**Size**: L (2-3 days, all 4 phases)
**Priority**: Important (enables asymmetric combat, ambushes)
**Depends On**: VS_007 (Turn Queue System - provides scheduling infrastructure)

**What**: Enemy FOV calculation, asymmetric vision (enemy sees you before you see them), basic AI decision-making (move toward player, attack when in range)

**Why**:
- **Ambush mechanics**: Enemies can detect player around corners, initiate combat first
- **Tactical depth**: Player must consider enemy patrol patterns and vision cones
- **AI foundation**: Enemies make autonomous decisions (move, attack, flee)
- **Reuses VS_007**: Parallel detection (PlayerDetectionEventHandler mirrors EnemyDetectionEventHandler)

**How**:
- **Phase 1**: Enemy perception attributes (vision radius, awareness zones)
- **Phase 2**: `PlayerDetectionEventHandler` (subscribes to enemy FOV events), `DecideEnemyActionQuery` (AI decision tree)
- **Phase 3**: Enemy FOV calculation (triggered by awareness zones), AI behavior states (passive, alerted, combat)
- **Phase 4**: Enemy activation zones (distance-based), enemy turn execution (move toward player OR attack)

**Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Enemy FOV calculation (when within awareness radius of player)
- ‚úÖ PlayerDetectionEventHandler (enemy sees player ‚Üí schedule enemy)
- ‚úÖ Asymmetric combat (enemy detects first, player discovers on move)
- ‚úÖ Basic AI (move toward player if not adjacent, attack if adjacent)
- ‚úÖ Awareness zones (only nearby enemies calculate FOV for performance)
- ‚ùå Advanced AI (flanking, kiting, cover usage - future)
- ‚ùå Behavior trees (simple decision tree for MVP)
- ‚ùå Patrol patterns (enemies stationary until activated)

**Example Scenario** (Ambush):
```
1. Player auto-paths down hallway (exploration mode)
2. Orc around corner (15 tiles away) - passive, not calculating FOV
3. Player reaches 10 tiles from Orc ‚Üí enters awareness zone
4. Orc FOV calculated ‚Üí Player visible ‚Üí ScheduleActorCommand(Orc)
5. Combat starts (queue = [Player, Orc]), auto-path cancels
6. Player doesn't see Orc yet (wall blocks player FOV)
7. Player moves 1 step ‚Üí FOV updates ‚Üí NOW sees Orc ("Orc ambushes you!")
8. Orc's turn ‚Üí DecideEnemyActionQuery ‚Üí Move toward player
```

**Done When**: Scenario above works. Enemies detect player independently. Basic AI (approach + attack). Zero refactoring of VS_007 turn queue (event-driven addition).

---

### VS_008: Slot-Based Inventory System (MVP) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: Complete (2025-10-02) | **Size**: M (5-6.5h, all 4 phases) | **Tests**: 23 passing
**Owner**: Dev Engineer

**Delivered**: Slot-based inventory (20 slots), `ItemId` primitive in Domain/Common, add/remove operations with capacity enforcement, UI panel with GridContainer (10√ó2 slots), query-based refresh (no events in MVP)

**Key Decision**: Inventory stores `ItemId` (not Item objects) - enables clean separation between container logic and item definitions (VS_009)

**Architecture**: Explicit creation pattern (`CreateInventoryCommand`), player-controlled actors only, InMemoryInventoryRepository with auto-creation, ServiceLocator only in `_Ready()`

**Archive**: [Completed_Backlog_2025-10.md](../../07-Archive/Completed_Backlog_2025-10.md#vs_008-slot-based-inventory-system) (lines 47-163)

---

### Future: Basic Combat System (Turn-Based)

**Status**: Not Yet Planned
**Depends On**: VS_007 (Smart Interruption) OR VS_006 if auto-interruption deferred

**What**: Simple turn-based combat with manually controlled dummy enemy

**Why**:
- Validate positioning tactics before adding AI complexity
- Test FOV integration (ranged attacks require line-of-sight)
- Foundation for AI behavior

**Scope**:
- **Domain**: `Weapon` value object (damage, no time costs yet)
- **Application**: `ExecuteAttackCommand` (uses VS_001 TakeDamageCommand), range checking
- **Infrastructure**: Attack validation (melee = adjacent, ranged = line-of-sight from FOV)
- **Presentation**:
  - Attack button appears when valid target in range
  - Turn indicator ("Player Turn" / "Dummy Turn")
  - Still using WASD to manually control dummy

**Attack Types** (Phase 1):
- **Melee**: Must be adjacent (8 tiles: orthogonal + diagonal)
- **Ranged**: Requires line-of-sight from FOV (max range 5 tiles)

**Turn-Based Flow**:
```
1. Player Turn: Move (arrow keys) OR Attack (if enemy in range/sight)
2. Dummy Turn: Manual control (WASD) OR Attack (if player in range/sight)
3. Repeat until one actor reaches 0 health
```

**NOT in Scope**:
- ‚ùå Time costs (still simple alternating turns)
- ‚ùå AI behavior (dummy is manually controlled)
- ‚ùå Weapon proficiency (add in VS_009)
- ‚ùå Multiple weapons (just sword for now)

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: Melee attack validates adjacency, Ranged attack validates FOV line-of-sight
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: Attack ‚Üí health reduces (uses VS_001 system)
- ‚úÖ Godot scene: Attack button enabled/disabled based on range + FOV
- ‚úÖ Manual validation:
  - Can't ranged attack through smoke (FOV blocks line-of-sight)
  - Can melee attack enemy in smoke (adjacency check only)
  - Turn-based flow feels tactical (positioning before attacking)

---

### Future: Tileset & Procedural Generation System

**Status**: Not Yet Planned (Ideas - Visual Polish)
**Depends On**: None (independent of VS_006)

**What**: Replace ColorRect grid with Godot TileMap + Kenney assets, add procedural map generation and autotiling

**Why**:
- Professional appearance (pixel art vs. colored rectangles)
- Visual variety (procedurally generated maps)
- Replayability (different map layouts each time)

**Scope**:
- Kenney Micro Roguelike tileset (8x8 sprites, CC0 license)
- PCG algorithm (BSP trees, cellular automata, or dungeon generation)
- Autotiling rules for seamless wall connections
- GridMap remains single source of truth (Presentation reads from Core)

**Notes**: ColorRect is currently functional - this is polish work that can be deferred until gameplay systems are mature.

---

### Future: Turn-Based AI

**Status**: Not Yet Planned
**Depends On**: Basic Combat System

**What**: Simple AI that uses FOV and makes turn-based tactical decisions

**Why**:
- Validate positioning creates tactical depth (AI chases when visible, patrols when not)
- Prove turn-based combat is fun before adding time-unit complexity
- Foundation for time-aware AI in VS_008

**Scope** (Minimal Viable AI):
- **Domain**: `AIBehavior` enum (Aggressive, Defensive, Balanced)
- **Application**: `CalculateAIActionCommand` (returns move or attack decision)
- **Infrastructure**: Simple decision tree (no pathfinding yet)

**AI Decision Logic**:
```
IF player visible (in AI's FOV):
  IF player in attack range:
    - Aggressive: Always attack
    - Defensive: Attack if health > 50%, else move away
    - Balanced: Attack if can kill player this turn
  ELSE:
    - Move toward player (closest adjacent tile)

IF player not visible:
  - Patrol (random adjacent tile) OR Idle
```

**NOT in Scope**:
- ‚ùå Pathfinding around obstacles (just move toward player, may get stuck)
- ‚ùå Tactical positioning (flanking, cover usage)
- ‚ùå Memory (doesn't remember last seen player position)
- ‚ùå Time-aware decisions (add in VS_008)

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: Aggressive AI attacks when player in range + visible
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: Defensive AI retreats when health < 50%
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: AI doesn't chase player if not in FOV
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: AI uses CalculateFOVQuery to check visibility
- ‚úÖ Manual playtest:
  - Hide behind smoke ‚Üí AI doesn't chase (can't see you)
  - Step into AI's FOV ‚Üí AI immediately moves toward you
  - 3 enemy types feel different (rat aggressive, bandit balanced, ogre defensive)

---

### Future: Time-Unit Queue Refactoring

**Status**: Not Yet Planned
**Depends On**: Turn-Based AI

**What**: Replace alternating turns with priority queue based on action time costs

**Why**:
- **Decision point**: Does turn-based positioning need timing complexity?
- If VS_007 playtesting shows positioning alone creates depth ‚Üí maybe time-unit is YAGNI
- If turn-based feels too simple ‚Üí time-unit adds "fast vs powerful" decisions
- This is a **refactoring** of working systems, not net-new features

**Scope**:
- **Domain**: `ActionQueue` entity, `TimeCost` value object
- **Application**: `EnqueueActionCommand`, `ProcessNextActionQuery`
- **Infrastructure**: Refactor turn manager to use priority queue
- **Presentation**: Queue visualization (timeline showing next 5 actions)

**Time Costs** (Phase 1 baseline):
- **Movement**: 100 units per tile
- **Melee Attack**: 100 units (sword baseline)
- **Ranged Attack**: 75 units (faster, less damage)
- **Wait**: 50 units (skip turn, regain initiative)

**Refactoring Tasks**:
1. Add time costs to existing MoveActorCommand
2. Add time costs to existing ExecuteAttackCommand
3. Replace turn manager with priority queue
4. Update AI to be time-aware (don't waste fast actions)
5. Add queue visualization UI

**NOT in Scope**:
- ‚ùå Weapon variety yet (just melee/ranged, add proficiency in VS_009)
- ‚ùå Variable time passage (environmental effects)
- ‚ùå Action interrupts/cancellation

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: Priority queue orders actions correctly by time
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: Fast actions get more turns (rat attacks 2x before ogre attacks 1x)
- ‚úÖ UI test: Queue timeline shows upcoming 5 actions
- ‚úÖ Manual playtest: Time-unit adds tactical depth vs. turn-based (A/B test with VS_007)
- ‚úÖ **Decision**: Keep time-unit OR revert to turn-based if complexity doesn't justify value

**Phase**: Refactoring (touches all 4 layers)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Keep turn-based version in git branch
- If time-unit doesn't add value ‚Üí revert and simplify
- Only proceed to proficiency if time-unit proves fun

---

### Future: Weapon Proficiency Tracking

**Status**: Not Yet Planned
**Depends On**: Time-Unit Queue (if that system is kept)

**What**: Track weapon usage and improve proficiency, reducing action time costs

**Why**:
- No-level progression system (Darklands philosophy)
- Proficiency makes time-unit system more rewarding (see improvement via faster actions)
- Creates specialization incentives (master daggers vs be generalist)

**Scope**:
- **Domain**: `WeaponProficiency` entity (weapon type + skill 0-100)
- **Application**: `RecordWeaponUseCommand`, `CalculateAttackTimeCostQuery`
- **Infrastructure**: Proficiency repository (in-memory)
- **Presentation**: Proficiency panel (progress bars per weapon type)

**Proficiency Formula** (tuned for 2-4 hour runs):
```
Base Time Cost = weapon base (dagger 50, sword 100, axe 150)
Proficiency Reduction = (skill / 100) √ó 0.30  // Max 30% at skill 100

Final Time Cost = Base √ó (1 - Proficiency Reduction)

Example:
- Dagger novice (skill 0): 50 units
- Dagger expert (skill 50): 42.5 units (-15%)
- Dagger master (skill 100): 35 units (-30%)
```

**Skill Gain**:
```
Gain per attack = 1 + (enemy_difficulty √ó 0.5)
- Rat: +1 skill
- Bandit: +1.5 skill
- Ogre: +2 skill

Time to mastery ‚âà 50-70 attacks (5-10 fights)
```

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: Attack with dagger ‚Üí skill increases, time cost reduces
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: 50 sword attacks ‚Üí 15% faster
- ‚úÖ Manual playtest: Progression feels rewarding (visible every 2-3 fights)

---

### Future: Arena Combat Integration (Phase 1 Complete)

**Status**: Not Yet Planned
**Depends On**: Combat systems + AI + (optionally) Proficiency

**What**: Fully playable arena with 5 waves, complete progression loop

**Why**:
- First shippable milestone (can gather real user feedback)
- Validates Phase 1 hypothesis: "Is tactical combat fun?"
- Decision point: Proceed to Phase 2 OR pivot

**Scope**:
- **Presentation**: Arena scene with:
  - 30x30 grid (walls + smoke terrain)
  - Player + 3 weapon types (dagger/sword/axe)
  - Enemy spawner (5 waves: rat ‚Üí rat√ó2 ‚Üí bandit ‚Üí bandit√ó2 ‚Üí ogre)
  - FOV visualization + fog of war
  - If VS_008 kept: Queue timeline, proficiency panel
  - If VS_008 skipped: Just turn indicator, simpler UI

**Victory/Defeat**:
- Victory: Survive 5 waves, show stats (proficiency gains, time survived)
- Defeat: Show progress, encourage retry with different strategy

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Manual playtest: Complete run feels fun, creates tactical decisions
- ‚úÖ FOV + terrain create interesting positioning puzzles
- ‚úÖ If time-unit: Timing adds depth, proficiency feels rewarding
- ‚úÖ If turn-based: Positioning alone creates sufficient depth
- ‚úÖ Players want to retry ("one more run" addiction)

**Phase**: 4 (Presentation integration)

**Playtest Questions**:
1. Do you make meaningful tactical decisions?
2. Does FOV + smoke create interesting scenarios?
3. [If time-unit] Does timing layer add enough value?
4. [If proficiency] Does progression feel rewarding?
5. Do you want to play again? Why?

**Phase 1 Decision Point**:
- ‚úÖ **Proceed to Phase 2** if playtesters report combat is fun
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pivot** if combat feels shallow or tedious

---

## üé® Phase 2: Itemization & Depth (Future)

**Goal**: Prove build variety creates different playstyles and replay value

**When to Start**: After VS_007 playtesting confirms combat is fun

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 months

### Completed & Planned Vertical Slices

**VS_009: Item Definition System (TileSet Metadata-Driven) ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

**Status**: Complete (2025-10-02) | **Size**: M (6-7h, all 4 phases) | **Tests**: 57 passing
**Owner**: Dev Engineer

**Delivered**: Item catalog using Godot TileSet custom data layers (item_name, item_type, max_stack_size), `TileSetItemRepository` auto-discovers items at startup, `ItemSpriteNode` (TextureRect) renders sprites with KeepAspectCentered, showcase scene displays 10 items with metadata

**Key Decision**: TileSet metadata (not JSON/C# definitions) - designers add items visually in Godot editor with zero code changes, single source of truth for sprites + properties

**Architecture**: Domain stores primitives (atlas coords), Infrastructure reads TileSet custom data layers, Core has zero Godot dependencies (ADR-002)

**Archive**: [Completed_Backlog_2025-10.md](../../07-Archive/Completed_Backlog_2025-10.md#vs_009-item-definition-system) (lines 166-312)

---

**VS_010: Item Stacking System**
- Stackable item support (e.g., "5√ó Branch", "20√ó Arrow")
- Stack limits per item type (configurable in item definitions)
- UI displays stack count overlay on slot visuals
- Commands: AddItemToStack, SplitStack, MergeStacks
- Benefits: Reduces inventory clutter for consumables and ammo
- Reference: NeoScavenger nStackLimit (branches=5, ammo=20, unique items=1)

**VS_011: Equipment Slots System**
- Actor equipment slots (main hand, off hand, head, torso, legs, ring√ó2)
- Used by ALL actors (player, NPCs, enemies) - not just player-controlled
- Player: Equips items from inventory ‚Üí equipment slots (affects stats)
- NPCs/Enemies: Spawned with pre-equipped gear (defines combat capabilities)
- Commands: EquipItem, UnequipItem, GetEquippedItems
- Integration: Combat system reads equipment for damage/defense calculations
- Reference: NeoScavenger battlemoves.xml (equipment affects available moves)
- Architecture: Separate from VS_008 Inventory (equipment = worn, inventory = carried)

**VS_012: Ground Loot System**
- Items at map positions (dungeon loot, enemy drops, player discards)
- WorldItemRepository: Dictionary<Position, List<ItemId>>
- Commands: DropItemAtPosition, PickupItemAtPosition, GetItemsAtPosition

- Integration: Enemy dies ‚Üí drops equipped items (VS_011) to ground
- UI: Visual indicators on tiles with loot (sparkle effect, item sprite)
- Foundation for dungeon generation loot placement

**VS_013: Container System (Nested Inventories)**
- Items can BE containers (bags, pouches, quivers)
- Nested spatial grids: Bag (4√ó6) can contain Pouch (2√ó2)
- Container properties: capacity grid size, allowed item types
- Type filtering: Quiver accepts arrows only, waterskin accepts liquids only
- Commands: OpenContainer, MoveItemToContainer
- Benefits: Organization (ammo in quiver), specialization (waterproof bags)
- Reference: NeoScavenger aCapacities ("4x6"), aContentIDs (whitelisted types)
- Decision point: May defer if VS_010 stacking reduces inventory clutter sufficiently

**VS_014: Simplified Armor System**
- Single armor layer (protection + weight values)
- Weight affects movement and action time costs
- Foundation for Phase 2 layered armor

**VS_015: Damage Type System**
- Slashing, Piercing, Blunt damage types
- Armor resistance to damage types
- Weapon choice matters based on enemy armor

**VS_016: Layered Armor (Padding + Mail)**
- Two armor layers (gambeson + chainmail)
- Hit location system (head/torso/limbs)
- Damage penetration mechanics

**VS_017: Unique Weapons Collection**
- 10 unique weapons with build-enabling properties
- Angband-style itemization (situational value)
- Constrained randomization (minor stat variance)

**VS_018: Spatial Inventory System ‚öôÔ∏è IN PROGRESS**

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete (2025-10-04) | **Size**: XL (ongoing) | **Tests**: 359 passing
**Owner**: Dev Engineer

**Phase 1 Delivered** (TD_003, TD_004):
- Tetris-style spatial inventory with **drag-drop** interaction
- Multi-cell items with L/T-shape support (coordinate-based masks)
- 90¬∞ rotation during drag (scroll wheel)
- Type filtering (equipment slots reject wrong item types)
- Component separation: `EquipmentSlotNode` (swap-focused) vs `InventoryContainerNode` (Tetris grid)
- TileSet-driven ItemShape encoding ("custom:0,0;1,0;1,1")
- Cell-by-cell collision detection (supports complex shapes)

**Architecture Achievements**:
- ItemShape value object with coordinate masks
- InventoryRenderHelper (DRY rendering across components)
- Zero business logic in Presentation (SSOT in Core)
- All 359 tests GREEN ‚úÖ

**Archive**: [Completed_Backlog_2025-10.md](../../07-Archive/Completed_Backlog_2025-10.md#vs_018-spatial-inventory-l-shapes) (Phase 1 documentation)

---

**Phase 2 TODO - UX & Interaction Improvements**:

1. **Click-to-Pick Interaction** (replace drag-drop)
   - Click item ‚Üí pick up (highlight follows cursor)
   - Click destination ‚Üí drop item
   - More tactile than drag-drop, easier on trackpads

2. **1v1 Swap Support**
   - Click occupied slot with picked item ‚Üí swap items (no intermediate drop needed)
   - Example: Swap weapon in hand directly with weapon in inventory
   - Preserves shapes, validates types

3. **Item Interaction System** (may become VS_019)
   - Right-click item ‚Üí context menu (Use, Split, Examine, Drop)
   - Use consumables (potions, food) from inventory
   - Examine for detailed stats/lore

4. **Nested Containers**
   - Items can BE containers (bags, pouches, quivers)
   - Double-click bag ‚Üí open container view (nested inventory grid)
   - Type filtering (quiver accepts arrows only)
   - Reference: NeoScavenger aCapacities

5. **Stack Support**
   - Stackable items (arrows √ó20, branches √ó5)
   - Stack count overlay on sprites
   - Split/merge stack operations
   - Links to VS_010 (Item Stacking System)

6. **Auto-Sort**
   - Sort by type (weapons, consumables, tools)
   - Sort by size (fill gaps efficiently)
   - Sort by value/weight

7. **Container Preview**
   - Hover over bag ‚Üí tooltip shows contents preview (mini grid)
   - Quick view without opening full container

8. **Ground Item Interaction**
   - Pick up items from environment (dungeon loot)
   - Visual indicators on tiles with items
   - Links to VS_012 (Ground Loot System)

9. **Rich Tooltips**
   - Item stats (damage, weight, durability)
   - Comparison tooltips (equipped vs inventory item)
   - Lore/description text

**Next Steps**: Prioritize TODOs after Phase 1 playtesting feedback

**VS_019: Crafting System (NeoScavenger-Style)**
- Grid-based crafting interface (drag items to recipe slots)
- Tool vs. Consumed separation (lighter stays, tinder burns)
- Time-based crafting (recipes take hours, not instant)
- Recipe discovery (try combinations, learn new recipes)
- Reference: NeoScavenger recipes.xml (tool/consumed/destroyed separation)
- Benefits: Survival depth (repair gear, purify water, cook food)

**Integration Milestone**: Phase 2 complete when 3+ viable builds emerge from playtesting

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 3: Strategic Layer (Future)

**Goal**: Demonstrate macro/micro loop integration works

**When to Start**: After Phase 2 builds are balanced and fun

**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 months

### Planned Vertical Slices (High-Level)

**VS_020: Overworld Map**
- Simple node-based map (3 towns, 2 dungeons)
- Travel system with time passage
- Location-based encounters

**VS_021: Quest System**
- Basic contracts (clear dungeon, deliver item)
- Quest giver NPCs in towns
- Rewards (money, reputation)

**VS_022: Economy System**
- Money from quests and loot
- Equipment purchases in towns
- Repair costs for gear degradation

**VS_023: Simple Reputation System**
- 2-3 factions with standing values
- Reputation affects prices and quest availability
- Foundation for Phase 4 emergent narrative

**Integration Milestone**: Phase 3 complete when macro ‚Üí micro ‚Üí macro loop feels cohesive

---

## üìñ Phase 4: Emergent Narrative (Future)

**Goal**: Create "memorable run stories" like RimWorld

**When to Start**: After Phase 3 macro/micro integration works

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 months

### Planned Vertical Slices (High-Level)

**VS_024: Origins System**
- 3-5 starting backgrounds (noble, soldier, peasant, scholar, merchant)
- Affects starting proficiencies, equipment, faction standings
- Defines early viable strategies

**VS_025: Event System**
- Random encounters with branching choices
- Consequences affect character state and reputation
- RimWorld-style procedural storytelling

**VS_026: Full Reputation System (N√óN Matrix)**
- Origin-specific quest lines unlock
- Faction relationships create emergent conflicts (enemy of my enemy)
- Dynamic world reacts to player choices
- Reference: NeoScavenger factions.xml (cross-faction reputation matrix)

**VS_027: Character Aging & Time Pressure**
- Character ages over time
- Stat degradation with age (realism)
- Creates natural run duration (2-4 hours before retirement/death)

**Integration Milestone**: Phase 4 complete when players share "remember when..." stories

## üìä Development Velocity Estimates

**Assumptions**:
- Working solo or small team
- Part-time development (10-20 hours/week)
- Includes testing, iteration, polish

**Phase 1** (Combat Core):
- 6 vertical slices √ó 1-2 days each = 12-18 dev days
- + Integration, playtesting, tuning = 6-10 additional days
- **Total: 3-6 months calendar time**

**Phase 2** (Itemization & Systems):
- 11 vertical slices √ó 1-3 days each = 24-38 dev days
- + Balance testing, build diversity, crafting recipes = 10-15 additional days
- **Total: 5-6 months calendar time**

**Phase 3** (Strategic):
- 4 vertical slices √ó 2-4 days each = 15-30 dev days
- + World integration, economy tuning = 10-15 additional days
- **Total: 4-6 months calendar time**

**Phase 4** (Narrative):
- 4 vertical slices √ó 2-3 days each = 12-20 dev days
- + Event writing, faction balance = 8-12 additional days
- **Total: 3-4 months calendar time**

**Full Roadmap: 15-23 months to first complete game** (27+ vertical slices)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### Risk 1: Time-Unit Combat Isn't Fun
**Mitigation**: Extensive playtesting after VS_007, pivot to simpler turn-based if needed

### Risk 2: Proficiency Grind Feels Tedious
**Mitigation**: Tunable formulas in VS_005, balance for 2-4 hour runs

### Risk 3: Scope Creep (Kitchen Sink Syndrome)
**Mitigation**: Strict phase gates - don't start Phase 2 until Phase 1 proves fun

### Risk 4: Layered Armor Too Complex
**Mitigation**: Phase 2 starts with simple armor (VS_008), only add layers if needed

### Risk 5: Solo Development Burnout
**Mitigation**: Shippable milestones every phase create motivation, early playtesting validates direction
