# Current Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 14:18
**Owner**: Product Owner (maintaining implementation truth)
**Purpose**: Ground truth of what's actually built vs what's planned

## üìä Overall Progress

**Phase Status**: Phase 1 ‚úÖ COMPLETE | Phase 2 üöß STARTING | Phase 3 ‚è≥ | Phase 4 ‚è≥

**Working Features**: None yet (foundation only)
**Next Milestone**: Combat Timeline Scheduler (VS_002)

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Foundation (VS_001 - Phase 1 COMPLETE)
- **3-Project Architecture**: Core, Tests, Godot properly separated
- **DI Container**: Transitioning from GameStrapper to Bootstrapper pattern (ADR-017)
- **Domain Model**:
  - TimeUnit value objects with full arithmetic/comparison
  - CombatAction records (dagger=500ms, sword=800ms, axe=1200ms)
  - TimeUnitCalculator for agility/encumbrance modifiers
- **Error Handling**: LanguageExt Fin<T> throughout domain
- **Logging**: Serilog with structured categories
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push all functional
- **Test Coverage**: 107 tests, 97% pass rate

## üöß What's Partial

### Application Layer (Phase 2)
- **MediatR Pipeline**: Configured but no commands/handlers yet
- **Timeline Scheduler**: Not started (VS_002 proposed)

## ‚ùå What's Not Started

### Infrastructure (Phase 3)
- State persistence
- Save/Load system
- Configuration management

### Presentation (Phase 4)
- Godot UI implementation
- View interfaces
- Input handling
- Turn order display

## üéØ Next Logical Steps

1. **BR_001** (CRITICAL BUG): Remove float/double math from TimeUnitCalculator
   - Blocks VS_002 and all future development
   - Replace with deterministic integer math
   
2. **VS_002** (Critical): Implement Combat Timeline Scheduler
   - Simple priority queue with ISchedulable interface
   - MUST include unique Guid Id for every entity
   - ScheduleActorCommand and ProcessTurnCommand handlers
   - Target: <100 lines of logic

2. **TD_001** (Important): Create setup documentation
   - Now unblocked since VS_001 complete
   - Document tools and environment setup

3. **Phase 3 Planning**: After VS_002, define state persistence

## üîç Reality Check

### What Actually Works End-to-End
- **Build System**: ‚úÖ Solution builds with zero warnings
- **Tests**: ‚úÖ All 107 tests pass
- **DI Container**: ‚úÖ Validates and resolves services
- **Domain Logic**: ‚úÖ TimeUnit calculations work correctly

### Known Issues
- **CRITICAL**: Float/double math in TimeUnitCalculator (BR_001)
- No unique IDs for entities yet
- No actual gameplay yet (foundation only)
- Godot project exists but has no implementation
- No commands/handlers using the MediatR pipeline yet

### Technical Debt Already Accumulating
- None significant yet - clean foundation from VS_001

## üìà Velocity Observations

- **VS_001**: Took 4-5 days (XL) - included critical bug fixes and comprehensive testing
- **Expected VS_002**: Should be 4 hours (S) with solid foundation

## üéÆ Player-Visible Progress

**Current State**: No playable features yet
**Next Visible**: After Phase 4 of VS_002 - will show turn order in UI
