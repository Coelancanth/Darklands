- **Average Score**: 60/100 (Good overall priority alignment)

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
**NONE** - Backlog is in excellent health

### Next Strategic Focus
1. **TD_007** (Score: 70/100) - Ready for Dev Engineer implementation
2. **TD_006** (Score: 50/100) - Low priority, implement when time permits

### Extraction Opportunities
**TD_008** archived with comprehensive extraction targets:
- ADR needed for GodotConsoleSink architecture
- HANDBOOK update for dual logging anti-pattern elimination  
- Test patterns for logging infrastructure
- Architecture patterns for Serilog sink implementation

## 📈 Health Indicators
