## 🚨 Critical Gaps
**3 new critical bugs discovered during VS_011 Phase 4 testing requiring immediate debugging attention:**

- **BR_003**: Multiple Player Creation Causing Movement Tracking Conflicts
  - Age: <1 hour (just discovered)
  - Owner: Debugger Expert ✅
  - Impact: Prevents proper player position updates, core gameplay broken
  - Next: Trace player entity creation flow

- **BR_004**: Fog of War Color Rendering Not Showing Proper Terrain Modulation  
  - Age: <1 hour (just discovered)
  - Owner: Debugger Expert ✅
  - Impact: Visual fog states unclear, affects gameplay readability
  - Next: Check GridView fog modulation implementation

- **BR_005**: Player Position Not Updating Correctly During Movement
  - Age: <1 hour (just discovered) 
  - Owner: Debugger Expert ✅
  - Impact: Position desync between vision and movement systems
  - Next: Investigate position tracking flow

## ⏰ Stale Reviews (>3 days)
**No stale items found** - all active items are recent or have appropriate owners

## 👤 Missing Owners
**No missing owners found** - all items have assigned owners per protocol

## 🔄 Ownership Mismatches
**No ownership mismatches found** - all BR items correctly assigned to Debugger Expert

## 🚧 Blocked Dependencies
**No blocked dependencies found** - VS_012 dependency on VS_011 is satisfied (infrastructure complete)

## 📊 Summary
- **Total Active Items**: 10 (added BR_003, BR_004, BR_005)
- **Critical Gaps**: 3 (all new BR items requiring immediate debugging)
- **Stale Reviews**: 0 (all recent items)
- **Missing Owners**: 0
- **Ownership Mismatches**: 0
- **Blocked Items**: 0
- **Ready to Start**: 7 (3 BR items need debugging attention)

## 🎯 Next Actions Needed
1. **URGENT - Debugger Expert**: Address BR_003-005 systematically
   - **Priority order**: BR_003 (player tracking) → BR_005 (position sync) → BR_004 (rendering)
   - **Root cause hypothesis**: BR_003 and BR_005 may be related (multiple player instances)
2. **Dev Engineer**: VS_012 ready to begin (VS_011 infrastructure complete)
3. **Continue planned work**: Other items remain on track

## ✅ Recent Completions
- **VS_011 Phase 4**: Core fog of war system implemented
  - Three-state visibility working (unseen/explored/visible)
  - Strategic 30x20 test grid functional
  - Vision calculations and shadowcasting operational
  - Basic fog rendering implemented
  - **Issues discovered**: Tracked as BR_003-005 for focused debugging

## 📈 Backlog Health Status
**Status**: **GOOD WITH CRITICAL DEBUGGING NEEDED** - VS_011 core functionality achieved major milestone with fog of war system operational. Three critical bugs discovered during testing require immediate Debugger Expert attention. Once resolved, system will be fully functional for VS_012 implementation.
