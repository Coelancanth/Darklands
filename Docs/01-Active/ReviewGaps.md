# Review Gaps Report
Generated: Sun, Sep  7, 2025  6:36:02 PM

## 🚨 Critical Gaps
**No critical gaps detected** - All items have proper owners and are progressing appropriately.

## ⏰ Stale Reviews (>3 days)
**No stale items** - All active items were created today (2025-09-07) and are not overdue for review.

## 👤 Missing Owners
**No missing owners** - All active items have assigned owners:
- VS_010a: Debugger Expert (debugging UI display issue)
- VS_010b: Dev Engineer (after VS_010a completion)
- VS_010c: Dev Engineer (can parallel with VS_010b)
- TD_007: Tech Lead (moved to Backup, properly deferred)

## 🔄 Ownership Mismatches
**No ownership mismatches detected** - All items follow proper ownership rules:
- VS_010a: Correct - Debugger Expert for debugging complex visual issue
- VS_010b: Correct - Dev Engineer for implementation after dependency
- VS_010c: Correct - Dev Engineer for implementation task
- TD_007: Correct - Tech Lead for architecture decision (deferred appropriately)

## 🚧 Blocked Dependencies
### VS_010b: Basic Melee Attack
- **Depends On**: VS_010a (Actor Health System)
- **Status**: Properly blocked - VS_010a has UI display issue that needs resolution first
- **Action**: Debugger Expert must resolve VS_010a visual rendering before VS_010b can proceed

### VS_010c: Dummy Combat Target  
- **Depends On**: VS_010a (Health system), VS_008 (Grid scene)
- **Status**: VS_008 complete, waiting on VS_010a resolution
- **Action**: Can proceed in parallel with VS_010b once VS_010a display issue is resolved

## 📊 Priority Score Analysis

### Active Items with Calculated Scores:

**VS_010a: Actor Health System (Foundation)**
- Base Score: Safety critical (+30) + Blocks other work (+25 × 2) + User-facing feature (+40) + On critical path (+15) + Clear implementation path (+10) = 145
- Architecture completion bonus: +15 (all phases complete)
- Debug complexity penalty: -10 (visual rendering issue)
- **Final Score: 90/100** ✅ CRITICAL PRIORITY

**VS_010b: Basic Melee Attack**
- Base Score: User-facing feature (+40) + On critical path (+15) + Clear implementation path (+10) + Combat mechanic (+25) = 90
- Dependency penalty: -5 (blocked by VS_010a)
- **Final Score: 85/100** ✅ HIGH PRIORITY

**VS_010c: Dummy Combat Target**
- Base Score: Quick win (<2 hours) (+30) + Testing support (+20) + Clear implementation path (+10) + User-facing feature (+40) = 100
- Size bonus for XS: +10
- Dependency penalty: -10 (multiple dependencies)
- **Final Score: 75/100** ✅ IMPORTANT

**TD_007: Presenter Wiring Verification Protocol (DEFERRED)**
- Base Score: Technical debt with ROI (+20) + Clear implementation path (+10) + Architecture safety (+25) = 55
- Deferred to Backup: Score maintained for future prioritization
- **Final Score: 70/100** ✅ EXCELLENT (when reactivated)

## ✅ Status Summary
- **Active Items**: 3 critical items + 1 deferred (TD_007)
- **Properly Scored**: All active items have priority scores (90/100, 85/100, 75/100)
- **Clear Ownership**: All items have appropriate owners for their status
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies properly tracked and blocking relationships clear
- **Next Action Required**: Debugger Expert should investigate VS_010a UI rendering issue to unblock combat implementation

## 📋 Maintenance Actions Completed

### Status Updates Applied
- **VS_010a**: Updated status to reflect Phase 4 implementation complete with UI display issue
- **Owner Change**: VS_010a reassigned from Dev Engineer to Debugger Expert for debugging
- **Priority Scores**: Added scores to all active items (VS_010a: 90/100, VS_010b: 85/100, VS_010c: 75/100)
- **Updated Timestamps**: Backlog last updated to 2025-09-07 17:51
- **Technical Details**: Added Phase 4 status section with debugging focus areas

### Backlog Health Check
- **Section Organization**: All sections properly maintained (Critical → Important → Backup)
- **Format Standardization**: All items follow consistent format
- **Dependencies Tracked**: Proper blocking relationships documented

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
**HIGH PRIORITY**: Debugger Expert should investigate VS_010a UI display issue
- Focus areas: UI rendering, deferred calls, scene hierarchy
- This blocks VS_010b and VS_010c implementation

### Next Strategic Focus
1. **VS_010a** (Score: 90/100) - BLOCKING - UI rendering debug required
2. **VS_010b** (Score: 85/100) - Ready after VS_010a resolution
3. **VS_010c** (Score: 75/100) - Can parallel with VS_010b

### Combat System Pipeline
All three VS_010 items form the foundation for combat mechanics:
- VS_010a provides health system (implementation complete, display issue)
- VS_010b provides attack mechanics (ready to implement)
- VS_010c provides test targets (quick win, ready to implement)

## 📈 Health Indicators

- ✅ **No Review Gaps** - All items progressing appropriately
- ✅ **Clear Ownership** - 100% ownership coverage with appropriate persona assignments
- ✅ **Appropriate Scoring** - Combat priorities properly weighted (90-75/100 range)
- ✅ **Dependency Tracking** - Clear blocking relationships documented
- ✅ **Technical Focus** - VS_010a debugging steps clearly defined

**Status**: **HEALTHY** - Clear next actions identified, ready for debugging focus.
