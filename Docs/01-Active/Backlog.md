## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### VS_006: Interactive Movement System
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer (for implementation)
**Size**: L (2-3 days)
**Priority**: Critical (core gameplay mechanic)
**Markers**: [GAMEPLAY] [USER-EXPERIENCE]

**What**: Point-and-click movement with A* pathfinding, visual path preview, and smooth tile-to-tile animation

**Why**:
- Natural interaction model (click where you want to go vs. mashing arrow keys)
- Tactical clarity (see path before committing ‚Üí enables strategic planning)
- Game feel (animation eliminates prototype jank)
- Foundation for all future targeting/interaction features

**How** (4-Phase Implementation):
- **Phase 1 (Domain)**: Minimal (existing Position/GridMap sufficient, ~1h)
- **Phase 2 (Application)**: `FindPathQuery` + `MoveAlongPathCommand` with waypoint list (~3h)
  - **CRITICAL**: Design `IPathfindingService.FindPath()` to accept `Func<Position, int> getMovementCost` parameter NOW (prevents refactoring later when action costs added)
- **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)**: `AStarPathfindingService` with Chebyshev distance heuristic (~4h)
  - A* implementation uses `getMovementCost(neighbor)` instead of hardcoded `1`
  - Performance target: <50ms for longest path on 30x30 grid
  - Tests: No path exists, start=end, complex obstacle navigation, varied costs (floor=1, smoke=2)
- **Phase 4 (Presentation)**: Mouse input + path visualization + Godot Tween animation (~4h)
  - Click ‚Üí show path overlay ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí animate each step
  - Initial usage passes `pos => 1` lambda (uniform cost for now)
  - FOV updates during movement (leverage existing event system)

**Scope:**
- ‚úÖ A* pathfinding around obstacles (8-directional movement per roguelike standard)
- ‚úÖ Mouse click to select destination
- ‚úÖ Visual path preview (highlight tiles)
- ‚úÖ Discrete tile-to-tile "jump" animation (0.1-0.2s per tile)
- ‚úÖ Path validation (clicking impassable tiles gives feedback)
- ‚úÖ **Design for action costs** (interface accepts cost function, implementation uses it, gameplay passes uniform cost=1)
- ‚úÖ Diagonal movement (8 directions: N/S/E/W + NE/NW/SE/SW, diagonal cost=1.0 per Caves of Qud)
- ‚úÖ **Manual path cancellation** via right-click (CancellationToken pattern, stops movement immediately)
- ‚ùå **Using** variable action costs in gameplay (Phase 4 passes `pos => 1`, but infrastructure ready for future VS)
- ‚ùå **Auto-interruption** (enemy spotted, loot discovered) - deferred to VS_007

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Click passable tile ‚Üí path visualized ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí smooth animated movement
- ‚úÖ Animation feels "jumpy" (discrete tiles, not smooth slide)
- ‚úÖ FOV overlay updates properly during movement
- ‚úÖ Clicking walls/impassable shows clear error feedback
- ‚úÖ All 189 existing tests still pass
- ‚úÖ Phase 3 performance test: Pathfinding completes in <50ms
- ‚úÖ Phase 3 cost variation test: A* finds optimal path when floor=1, smoke=2 (validates cost system works)
- ‚úÖ Manual test: Click across map ‚Üí actor navigates around walls ‚Üí FOV follows
- ‚úÖ Manual test: Right-click during movement ‚Üí movement stops immediately at current tile
- ‚úÖ Code review confirms:
  - Event-driven architecture (no polling in Presentation)
  - `IPathfindingService.FindPath()` accepts cost function (future-proof interface)
  - A* implementation uses provided cost function (not hardcoded)

**Depends On**: VS_005 (Grid + FOV) - ‚úÖ Complete

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-10-01 15:40, updated 15:50):
- **Scope Challenge Resolved**: Keep as ONE comprehensive VS (not split into pathfinding + animation)
- **Rationale**: Path visualization, animation, and pathfinding deliver incomplete value when separated. Shipping "click to move but it teleports" would feel broken.
- **Movement Direction Revised**: 8-directional (changed from initial 4-directional to match roguelike genre standard per Tech Lead research)
- **Action Cost Decision** (credit: user feedback): Design infrastructure to accept variable costs NOW, use uniform cost=1 in VS_006 gameplay
  - **Why**: Adding `Func<Position, int> getCost` parameter costs ~10 minutes but prevents major refactoring when action costs added later (VS_008+)
  - **Benefit**: Phase 3 can test cost variations (floor=1, smoke=2) even though gameplay doesn't use them yet ‚Üí validates algorithm correctness
  - **Risk Mitigation**: Zero cost to gameplay in VS_006, zero breaking changes when costs become real in future VS
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium (mostly animation complexity with Godot Tween async)
- **Next Step**: Tech Lead breaks down implementation and approves architecture

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-10-01 16:02, updated 16:17 for 8-directional + right-click cancel):
- **Architecture Approved**: NEW FEATURE `Features/Movement/` (separate from Grid per ADR-004)
  - **Rationale**: Grid handles terrain/positions/FOV, Movement handles pathfinding/navigation
  - Clear separation prevents Grid from becoming god-feature
- **Phase 1 (~1h)**: Minimal - folder structure only, no new domain models (reuse Position)
- **Phase 2 (~3h)**: `FindPathQuery` + `MoveAlongPathCommand`
  - `IPathfindingService.FindPath(start, goal, isPassable, getCost)` - **REFINED**: Separate `Func<Position,bool> isPassable` and `Func<Position,int> getCost` for clearer semantics
  - `MoveAlongPathCommand` delegates to existing `MoveActorCommand` per step (reuses validation, FOV, events)
  - **Key Decision**: Emit `ActorMovedEvent` PER STEP (enables discrete tile animation + FOV updates)
  - **Cancellation**: Handler respects `CancellationToken` - checks `ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` before each step
- **Phase 3 (~4h)**: `AStarPathfindingService` with Chebyshev heuristic
  - 8-directional (N/S/E/W + NE/NW/SE/SW), diagonal cost=1.0, PriorityQueue for open set
  - Performance target: <50ms (enforced by test)
  - Cost variation test validates algorithm correctness (floor=1, smoke=2 scenario)
- **Phase 4 (~4.5h)**: `MovementInputController` + `PathVisualizationNode` (Godot)
  - Left-click ‚Üí FindPathQuery ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Left-click again ‚Üí MoveAlongPathCommand ‚Üí Animate
  - Right-click ‚Üí Cancel active movement (via `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel()`)
  - **Animation**: Godot Tween for 0.1-0.2s tile-to-tile "jump" (current handler does instant teleport - needs update)
- **Event Topology**: Reuse `ActorMovedEvent` (terminal subscriber, depth=1, ADR-004 compliant)
- **ADR Compliance**: ‚úÖ All 4 ADRs validated (Clean Architecture, Godot boundary, Result<T>, Event Rules)
- **Total Estimate**: 12.5h (1.5-2 days) - includes manual cancellation via right-click
- **Risks**: A* performance (mitigated by algorithm choice + benchmark test), Godot Tween async (mitigated by existing pattern)
- **Next Step**: Hand off to Dev Engineer for Phase 1-4 implementation

**Dev Engineer Progress** (2025-10-01 16:32, Phase 1 complete 16:33, Phase 2 complete 16:40, Phase 3 complete 16:59):
- **Architecture Review Complete**: ADR alignment validated, existing Grid/FOV patterns studied
- **Interface Refinement**: Separated passability check from cost calculation for clearer A* semantics
  - **Rationale**: Boolean passability (can/cannot) vs quantitative cost (how expensive) are distinct concerns
  - **Benefit**: A* checks passability first (more efficient), clearer contract for callers
- **‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete** (~30 min actual, 1h estimated)
  - Created `Features/Movement/` folder structure (Domain/Application/Infrastructure layers)
  - Defined `IPathfindingService` interface with `isPassable` + `getCost` parameters
  - **Tests**: All 189 existing tests pass ‚úÖ
  - **Key Insight**: No new domain models needed - Position from Domain/Common sufficient (validates ADR-004 shared primitive strategy)
- **‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete** (~1h actual, 3h estimated - ahead of schedule!)
  - **Query Layer**: `FindPathQuery` + handler (thin wrapper, delegates to service)
  - **Command Layer**: `MoveAlongPathCommand` + handler with cancellation support
  - **Key Design**: Command composition - delegates to existing `MoveActorCommand` per step (reuses validation, FOV, events)
  - **Cancellation Strategy**: Checks `IsCancellationRequested` before each step (graceful stop, no rollback)
  - **Tests**: 14 new tests (7 query, 7 command) covering valid paths, failures, cancellation, architecture validation
  - **Total Tests**: 203 pass (189 existing + 14 new Phase 2) ‚úÖ
  - **Key Insight**: Graceful cancellation returns `Result.Success()` with partial completion (not exception) - actor stays at current tile
- **‚úÖ Phase 3 Complete** (~2h actual, 4h estimated - ahead of schedule!)
  - **A* Implementation**: `AStarPathfindingService` with 8-directional movement + Chebyshev heuristic
  - **Algorithm Details**: PriorityQueue for open set, HashSet for closed set, Chebyshev distance `max(|dx|, |dy|)` (optimal for diagonal movement)
  - **Bug Fixed**: Unbounded exploration crash - tests needed bounds in `isPassable` functions to prevent infinite space exploration
  - **Tests**: 12 new tests covering paths, obstacles, cost variation, edge cases, 8-directions, performance (<50ms), maze solving
  - **Total Tests**: 215 pass (189 existing + 14 Phase 2 + 12 Phase 3) ‚úÖ
  - **Performance**: <50ms for longest path on 30x30 grid (meets VS_006 requirement)
  - **Key Insight**: Separate `openSetHash` for O(1) membership checks prevents O(n) lookups with PriorityQueue.UnorderedItems.Any()
- **‚úÖ Phase 4 Complete** (~1.5h actual, 4.5h estimated - ahead of schedule!)
  - **DI Registration**: `AStarPathfindingService` registered in `GameStrapper.RegisterCoreServices()`
  - **Mouse Input**: Left-click executes movement, right-click cancels (ColorRect.MouseFilter.Stop enables input capture)
  - **Hover-Based Path Preview**: Orange overlay updates dynamically as mouse moves over tiles (standard roguelike UX)
  - **Movement Animation**: 100ms delay per tile for visible step-by-step movement (10 tiles/second)
  - **Graceful Cancellation**: `TaskCanceledException` handling during delays, path preview clears on cancel
  - **Debug Output**: Console prints full path coordinates for pathfinding verification
  - **Total Tests**: 215 pass (all existing tests + Core changes) ‚úÖ
  - **Key Insight**: Hover preview uses `InputEventMouseMotion` to recalculate paths on-the-fly - no click needed to see where you'll go
  - **Known Issue**: A* pathfinding may not produce straight lines for unobstructed paths (needs investigation)
  - **Next**: Bug fix for pathfinding optimality
