# Darklands Development Backlog


**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02 10:48 (Tech Lead: Added VS_008 Inventory System with full specification)

**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> 📚 See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## 🔢 Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 004
- **Next TD**: 003
- **Next VS**: 009


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter → Use that number → Increment the counter → Update timestamp

## 📖 How to Use This Backlog

### 🧠 Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | → Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | → Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ← Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ← Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

## 📈 Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

### VS_007: Smart Movement Interruption ⭐ **PLANNED**

**Status**: Proposed (depends on VS_006 completion)
**Owner**: Product Owner → Tech Lead (for breakdown)
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important (UX polish for core mechanic)
**Depends On**: VS_006 (Interactive Movement - manual cancellation foundation)

**What**: Auto-interrupt movement when tactical situations change (enemy spotted in FOV, trap/loot discovered, dangerous terrain)

**Why**:
- **Safety**: Prevent walking into danger (enemy appears → stop immediately)
- **Discovery**: Don't walk past important items (loot, traps require investigation)
- **Roguelike Standard**: NetHack, DCSS, Cogmind all auto-stop on enemy detection
- **Tactical Awareness**: Game alerts player to changing battlefield conditions

**How** (4-Phase Implementation):
- **Phase 1 (Domain)**: Minimal (reuse existing Position, ActorId)
- **Phase 2 (Application)**: `IMovementStateService` to track active movements, `InterruptMovementCommand`
- **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)**: Movement state tracking (in-memory), interruption policy engine
- **Phase 4 (Presentation)**:
  - Subscribe to `FOVCalculatedEvent` → detect new enemies → trigger interruption
  - Animation cleanup: Stop Tween gracefully when interrupted

**Interruption Triggers**:
1. **Enemy Detection** (Critical): New enemy appears in FOV → pause movement
2. **Discovery Events** (Important): Step on tile reveals loot/trap → pause for investigation
3. **Dangerous Terrain** (Future): About to enter fire/acid → confirm before proceeding

**Scope**:
- ✅ Auto-pause when enemy enters FOV during movement
- ✅ Clean animation stop (no mid-tile glitches)
- ✅ Movement state service tracks active paths
- ❌ Memory of "last seen enemy position" (AI feature, not movement)
- ❌ Configurable interruption settings (add in settings VS later)

**Done When**:
- ✅ Walking across map → enemy appears in FOV → movement stops automatically
- ✅ Prompt appears: "Goblin spotted! Continue moving? [Y/N]"
- ✅ Player presses Y → resumes path, N → cancels remaining movement
- ✅ Animation stops cleanly at current tile (no visual glitches)
- ✅ Manual test: Walk toward hidden enemy behind smoke → movement stops when smoke clears and enemy visible
- ✅ Code review: FOVCalculatedEvent subscriber triggers interruption (event-driven, no polling)

**Architecture Integration**:
- Builds on VS_006's `CancellationToken` foundation (manual cancel becomes "interruption trigger")
- `MoveAlongPathCommand` already respects cancellation → just need external trigger
- Event-driven: `FOVCalculatedEvent` → Check for new enemies → Call `InterruptMovementCommand`

**Phase**: All 4 phases (Domain minimal, Application + Infrastructure core, Presentation UI prompts

## 💡 Ideas (Future Work)
*Future features, nice-to-haves, deferred work*

**No items in Ideas section!** ✅

*Future work is tracked in [Roadmap.md](../02-Design/Game/Roadmap.md) with dependency chains and sequencing.*

## 📋 Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** → 🔥 Critical
2. **Current milestone?** → 📈 Important  
3. **Everything else** → 💡 Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes → Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with 🔥 priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
