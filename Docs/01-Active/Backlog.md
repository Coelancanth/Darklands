# Darklands Development Backlog


**Last Updated**: 2025-09-08 14:23

**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> üìö See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## üî¢ Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 002
- **Next TD**: 012  
- **Next VS**: 011 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ‚Üê Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ‚Üê Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*



## üìà Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*







## üóÑÔ∏è Backup (Complex Features for Later)
*Advanced mechanics postponed until core loop is proven fun*

### TD_007: Presenter Wiring Verification Protocol [ARCHITECTURE] [Score: 70/100]
**Status**: Proposed ‚Üê MOVED TO BACKUP 2025-09-07 15:57 (Product Owner priority decision)
**Owner**: Tech Lead (Architecture decision needed)
**Size**: M (4-6h including tests and documentation)
**Priority**: Deferred (Focus on combat mechanics first)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TESTING] [POST-MORTEM-ACTION]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 13:36

**What**: Establish mandatory wiring verification protocol for all presenter connections
**Why**: TD_005 post-mortem revealed 2-hour debug caused by missing GridPresenter‚ÜíActorPresenter wiring

**Problem Statement** (from Post-Mortem lines 58-64):
- GridPresenter wasn't calling ActorPresenter.HandleActorMovedAsync()
- Silent failure - no compile error, no runtime error, just missing behavior
- Manual wiring in GameManager is error-prone and untested

**Proposed Solution**:
1. **Mandatory Wiring Tests**: Every presenter pair MUST have wiring verification tests
2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Consider IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
3. **Runtime Verification**: Add VerifyWiring() method called in GameManager._Ready()
4. **Test Pattern**: Create WiringAssert helper for consistent wiring test assertions

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create presenter wiring test suite (PresenterCoordinationTests.cs)
- [ ] Add IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
- [ ] Implement VerifyWiring() runtime check in GameManager
- [ ] Document wiring test pattern in testing guidelines
- [ ] Add wiring tests to CI pipeline gate

**Done When**:
- All existing presenter pairs have wiring tests
- Runtime verification catches missing wiring on startup
- CI fails if wiring tests are missing for new presenters
- Documentation explains the wiring test pattern

**Depends On**: None (can start immediately)

**Tech Lead Analysis** (2025-09-07):
- **Complexity Score**: 4/10 (Well-understood problem with clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Similar to DI container validation pattern
- **Risk**: None - purely additive safety measures
- **ROI**: HIGH - Prevents hours of debugging for minutes of test writing
- **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-09-07 15:57):
- **DEFERRED TO BACKUP** - Combat mechanics take priority
- Important infrastructure but not blocking core game loop
- Revisit after VS_002 and VS_010a/b/c are complete

 **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

## üìã Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** ‚Üí üî• Critical
2. **Current milestone?** ‚Üí üìà Important  
3. **Everything else** ‚Üí üí° Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes ‚Üí Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with üî• priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
