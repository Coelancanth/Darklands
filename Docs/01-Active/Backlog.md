# Darklands Development Backlog


**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30 15:38 (VS_003 approved with category-based design - Tech Lead decision)

**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> üìö See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## üî¢ Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 001
- **Next TD**: 001
- **Next VS**: 005 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*


### VS_004: Infrastructure - Event Bus System [ARCHITECTURE]
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown)
**Size**: S (4-6h)
**Priority**: Critical (Prerequisite for Core ‚Üí Godot communication)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [INFRASTRUCTURE]
**Created**: 2025-09-30

**What**: GodotEventBus to bridge MediatR domain events to Godot nodes
**Why**: Core domain logic needs to notify Godot UI of state changes without coupling

**Scope**:
1. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - GodotEventBus (subscribes to MediatR INotification)
   - Thread marshalling to main thread (CallDeferred)
   - EventAwareNode base class (subscribe/unsubscribe pattern)
   - Automatic cleanup on node disposal

2. **Tests**:
   - Can publish event from Core
   - Godot node receives event
   - Thread marshalling works correctly
   - Unsubscribe prevents memory leaks

**How** (Implementation Order):
1. **Phase 1: Domain** (~1h)
   - Define event interfaces
   - Simple test event (TestEvent)

2. **Phase 2: Application** (~1h)
   - GodotEventBus implements INotificationHandler<T>
   - Event subscription registry

3. **Phase 3: Infrastructure** (~2h)
   - Thread marshalling implementation
   - EventAwareNode base class
   - Automatic unsubscribe on _ExitTree()

4. **Phase 4: Presentation** (~1h)
   - Simple test scene with EventAwareNode
   - Publish test event from Core
   - Verify node receives event on main thread
   - Manual test: Event updates Godot UI correctly

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Can publish MediatR notification from Core
- ‚úÖ Godot nodes receive events via EventBus.Subscribe<T>()
- ‚úÖ Events delivered on main thread (no threading issues)
- ‚úÖ EventAwareNode auto-unsubscribes on disposal
- ‚úÖ Tests verify no memory leaks from subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Simple test scene demonstrates Core ‚Üí Godot event flow
- ‚úÖ Code committed with message: "feat: event bus system [VS_004]"

**Depends On**: VS_002 (needs DI)

### VS_001: Architectural Skeleton - Health System Walking Skeleton [ARCHITECTURE]
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown)
**Size**: S (4-6h)
**Priority**: Critical (Validates architecture with real feature)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [WALKING-SKELETON] [END-TO-END]
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Updated**: 2025-09-30 (Reduced scope - DI/Logger/EventBus now separate)

**What**: Implement minimal health system to validate complete architecture end-to-end
**Why**: Prove the architecture works with a real feature after infrastructure is in place

**Context**:
- VS_002, VS_003, VS_004 provide foundation (DI, Logger, EventBus)
- This is the FIRST REAL FEATURE using that foundation
- Follow "Walking Skeleton" pattern: thinnest possible slice through all layers
- Validates ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003 work together

**Scope** (Minimal Health System):
1. **Domain Layer** (Pure C#):
   - Health value object with Create/Reduce/Increase
   - IHealthComponent interface
   - HealthComponent implementation
   - Use Result<T> for all operations

2. **Application Layer** (CQRS):
   - TakeDamageCommand + Handler (uses ILogger<T>, publishes events)
   - HealthChangedEvent (INotification)
   - Simple in-memory component registry

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Register health services in GameStrapper
   - ComponentRegistry implementation

4. **Presentation Layer** (Godot):
   - Simple test scene with one actor sprite
   - HealthComponentNode (EventAwareNode, shows health bar)
   - Button to damage actor
   - Verify: Click button ‚Üí Command ‚Üí Event ‚Üí Health bar updates

5. **Tests**:
   - Health value object tests (validation, reduce, increase)
   - TakeDamageCommandHandler tests (with mocked logger)
   - Integration test: Command ‚Üí Event flow

**NOT in Scope** (defer to later):
- Grid system
- Movement
- Complex combat mechanics
- Multiple actors
- AI
- Turn system
- Fancy UI

**How** (Implementation Order):
1. **Phase 1: Domain** (~1h)
   - Create Health value object with tests
   - Create IHealthComponent + HealthComponent
   - Tests: Health.Create, Reduce, validation with Result<T>

2. **Phase 2: Application** (~2h)
   - TakeDamageCommand + Handler (inject ILogger, IMediator)
   - HealthChangedEvent (INotification)
   - ComponentRegistry service
   - Tests: Handler logic with mocked logger and registry

3. **Phase 3: Infrastructure** (~1h)
   - Register services in GameStrapper
   - ComponentRegistry implementation
   - Verify DI resolution works

4. **Phase 4: Presentation** (~2h)
   - Simple scene (1 sprite + health bar + damage button)
   - HealthComponentNode extends EventAwareNode
   - Subscribe to HealthChangedEvent
   - Wire button click ‚Üí Send TakeDamageCommand
   - Manual test: Click button ‚Üí see logs ‚Üí health bar updates

**Done When**:
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds (dotnet build)
- ‚úÖ Core tests pass (100% pass rate)
- ‚úÖ Godot project loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Can click "Damage" button and health bar updates smoothly
- ‚úÖ Logs appear in debug console showing command execution
- ‚úÖ No Godot references in Darklands.Core project
- ‚úÖ GodotEventBus routes HealthChangedEvent correctly
- ‚úÖ CSharpFunctionalExtensions Result<T> works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ All 3 ADRs validated with working code
- ‚úÖ Code committed with message: "feat: health system walking skeleton [VS_001]"

**Depends On**: VS_002 (DI), VS_003 (Logger), VS_004 (EventBus)

**Product Owner Notes** (2025-09-30):
- This is the FOUNDATION - everything else builds on this
- Keep it MINIMAL - resist adding features
- Validate architecture first, optimize later
- Success = simple but complete end-to-end flow

**Acceptance Test Script**:
```
1. Run: dotnet build src/Darklands.Core/Darklands.Core.csproj
   Expected: Build succeeds, no warnings

2. Run: dotnet test tests/Darklands.Core.Tests/Darklands.Core.Tests.csproj
   Expected: All tests pass

3. Open Godot project
   Expected: No errors in console

4. Run test scene
   Expected: See sprite with health bar above it

5. Click "Damage" button
   Expected: Health bar decreases, animation plays

6. Click repeatedly until health reaches 0
   Expected: Sprite disappears or "Dead" appears
```

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes ‚Üí Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with üî• priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
