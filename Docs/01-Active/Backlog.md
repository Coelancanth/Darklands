## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üí° Ideas (Future Work)
*Future features, nice-to-haves, deferred work*

### VS_022: World Generation Pipeline (Incremental Post-Processing)
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown)
**Size**: XL (multi-phase, build incrementally)
**Priority**: Ideas
**Markers**: [WORLDGEN] [ARCHITECTURE] [INCREMENTAL]

**What**: Build post-processing pipeline on top of native plate tectonics output - elevation normalization, climate, erosion, biomes - **one algorithm at a time** with proper testing

**Why**: Current system outputs raw heightmap only. Need processed terrain data (ocean masks, climate zones, biomes) for gameplay. Clean foundation (native-only) established in refactor commit f84515d.

**Current State** (2025-10-08):
- ‚úÖ Native library wrapper working (heightmap + plates)
- ‚úÖ Modular visualization (5 focused nodes, ~700 lines)
- ‚úÖ 433 tests GREEN
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture (no premature complexity)
- ‚ùå No post-processing (intentional - start simple!)

**Proposed Incremental Approach:**
1. **Phase 1: Elevation Normalization** (S, ~4h)
   - Normalize raw heightmap to [0, 1] range
   - Calculate dynamic sea level threshold (Otsu's method)
   - Add ocean mask generation
   - Tests: Verify normalization, sea level calculation

2. **Phase 2: Climate - Temperature** (M, ~6h)
   - Temperature calculation (latitude + elevation cooling)
   - Temperature map visualization
   - Tests: Temperature gradient validation

3. **Phase 3: Climate - Precipitation** (M, ~6h)
   - Precipitation calculation (with rain shadow)
   - Precipitation map visualization
   - Tests: Precipitation patterns

4. **Phase 4: Hydraulic Erosion** (L, ~12h)
   - River generation (flow accumulation)
   - Valley carving around rivers
   - Lake formation
   - Tests: River connectivity, erosion effects

5. **Phase 5: Hydrology** (M, ~8h)
   - Watermap (droplet simulation)
   - Irrigation (moisture spreading)
   - Humidity (combined moisture metric)
   - Tests: Flow patterns, moisture distribution

6. **Phase 6: Biome Classification** (M, ~6h)
   - Holdridge life zones model
   - Biome map generation
   - Biome visualization + legends
   - Tests: Biome distribution validation

**Technical Principles:**
- ‚úÖ **One algorithm at a time** - No big-bang integration
- ‚úÖ **Test coverage for each phase** - Regression protection
- ‚úÖ **Visual validation** - Probe + view modes for each stage
- ‚úÖ **Algorithm independence** - Each phase self-contained
- ‚úÖ **ADR documentation** - Capture design decisions

**References:**
- [TD_009: Pipeline Gap Analysis](../08-Learnings/WorldEngine/TD_009-Pipeline-Gap-Analysis.md) - WorldEngine algorithms inventory
- [TD_011 completion notes](../08-Learnings/WorldEngine/TD_011-completion-notes.md) - Sea level bug + cleanup lessons
- Refactor commit: `f84515d` (removed 5808 lines, modular nodes)

**Done When:**
- All 6 phases complete with tests
- Each algorithm has visual validation mode
- Biome map renders correctly
- Performance acceptable (<10s for 512√ó512 world)
- Documentation updated with architecture decisions

**Depends On**: None (foundation ready)

**Next Steps:**
1. Product Owner: Review and approve scope
2. Tech Lead: Break down Phase 1 into detailed tasks
3. Dev Engineer: Implement Phase 1 (elevation normalization)

## üìã Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** ‚Üí üî• Critical
2. **Current milestone?** ‚Üí üìà Important  
3. **Everything else** ‚Üí üí° Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes ‚Üí Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with üî• priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
