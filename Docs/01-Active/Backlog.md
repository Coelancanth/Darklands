## üî¢ Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 002
- **Next TD**: 012  
- **Next VS**: 011 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### TD_011: Async/Concurrent Architecture Mismatch in Turn-Based Game [ARCHITECTURE]
**Status**: Approved ‚Üí Ready for Dev (Tech Lead, 2025-09-07 21:34)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (immediate implementation required)
**Size**: L (13 hours - 5 phases)
**Priority**: Critical (Fundamental design flaw causing bugs)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [BREAKING-CHANGE] [ROOT-CAUSE]

**What**: Remove async/await patterns from turn-based game flow; implement proper sequential processing
**Why**: Turn-based games are inherently sequential - async creates race conditions and complexity

**Root Cause Analysis** (from BR_001 investigation):
- ActorView uses shared fields (_pendingActorNode, _pendingActorId) with CallDeferred
- Multiple actors created simultaneously overwrite each other's pending data
- Player actor creation gets overwritten by dummy actor creation
- Async Task.Run() calls in presenters violate turn-based sequential nature

**Evidence of Architectural Mismatch**:
```csharp
// CURRENT BROKEN: Concurrent actor creation
Task.Run(async () => await View.DisplayActorAsync(...));  // Actor 1
Task.Run(async () => await View.DisplayActorAsync(...));  // Actor 2 overwrites Actor 1
// Result: Race condition, only last actor displays

// SHOULD BE: Sequential turn-based processing
scheduler.GetNextActor();
ProcessAction();
UpdateUI();  // Synchronous, no race possible
```

**Proposed Architecture**:
1. **Scene Init**: Create ALL actors at once, display them all
2. **Game Loop**: Process turns sequentially (player first, initiative 0)
3. **No Async UI**: All view updates synchronous (Godot auto-updates on data change)
4. **Turn Processing**: One actor ‚Üí One action ‚Üí One UI update ‚Üí Next actor

**Required Changes**:
- [ ] Remove async/await from IActorView interface
- [ ] Fix ActorView race condition (queue or remove shared fields)
- [ ] Create GameLoopPresenter for turn management
- [ ] Connect CombatScheduler to presentation layer
- [ ] Refactor actor initialization to batch creation

**Done When**:
- All actors display correctly on scene start
- Turn-based loop processes sequentially
- No race conditions in UI updates
- Player acts first (initiative 0)

**Depends On**: None (architectural foundation)

**Debugger Expert Analysis** (2025-09-07 21:21):
- BR_001 was symptom, not cause - removing it as redundant
- Async patterns inappropriate for turn-based games
- MVP separation is correct, implementation is wrong
- Need Tech Lead architecture decision before proceeding

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-07 21:34): **APPROVED WITH URGENCY**
- **Complexity Score**: 7/10 (Well-understood problem, clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Traditional roguelike sequential processing (SPD, NetHack, DCSS)
- **Risk Assessment**: HIGH if not fixed - every feature will fight async pattern
- **ADR-009 Created**: Sequential Turn-Based Processing Pattern documented
- **Solution Validated**: Aligns with Vision.md time-unit combat requirements

**Implementation Phases** (13 hours total):
1. **Phase 1 (2h)**: Verify domain/application synchronous - add architecture tests
2. **Phase 2 (3h)**: Create GameLoopCoordinator for turn orchestration
3. **Phase 3 (4h)**: Remove ALL Task.Run() and async from presenters
4. **Phase 4 (2h)**: Fix ActorView race with proper CallDeferred usage
5. **Phase 5 (2h)**: Integration testing and validation

**Critical Changes Required**:
- Remove Task.Run() from all presenters (lines 113, 118, 184, 189)
- Fix shared field race in ActorView (lines 31-35)
- Make all IView interfaces synchronous
- Implement sequential game loop pattern per ADR-009

**Handoff to Dev Engineer**: This blocks ALL combat work. Implement immediately following ADR-009 pattern.

### VS_010c: Dummy Combat Target [Score: 75/100]  
**Status**: BLOCKED by BR_001 (Dev Engineer, 2025-09-07 21:05)
**Owner**: Blocked - awaiting Debugger Expert resolution
**Size**: XS (0.2 days remaining - only scene integration left)
**Priority**: Critical (Testing/visualization)
**Markers**: [TESTING] [SCENE]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 16:13

- ‚úÖ SpawnDummyCommand places at grid position
- ‚úÖ Registers in actor state + grid services
- üîÑ brown sprite with health bar

- Note: Becomes reusable prefab for future enemies



## üóÑÔ∏è Backup (Complex Features for Later)
*Advanced mechanics postponed until core loop is proven fun*

### TD_007: Presenter Wiring Verification Protocol [ARCHITECTURE] [Score: 70/100]
**Status**: Proposed ‚Üê MOVED TO BACKUP 2025-09-07 15:57 (Product Owner priority decision)
**Owner**: Tech Lead (Architecture decision needed)
**Size**: M (4-6h including tests and documentation)
**Priority**: Deferred (Focus on combat mechanics first)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TESTING] [POST-MORTEM-ACTION]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 13:36

**What**: Establish mandatory wiring verification protocol for all presenter connections
**Why**: TD_005 post-mortem revealed 2-hour debug caused by missing GridPresenter‚ÜíActorPresenter wiring

**Problem Statement** (from Post-Mortem lines 58-64):
- GridPresenter wasn't calling ActorPresenter.HandleActorMovedAsync()
- Silent failure - no compile error, no runtime error, just missing behavior
- Manual wiring in GameManager is error-prone and untested

**Proposed Solution**:
1. **Mandatory Wiring Tests**: Every presenter pair MUST have wiring verification tests
2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Consider IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
3. **Runtime Verification**: Add VerifyWiring() method called in GameManager._Ready()
4. **Test Pattern**: Create WiringAssert helper for consistent wiring test assertions

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create presenter wiring test suite (PresenterCoordinationTests.cs)
- [ ] Add IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
- [ ] Implement VerifyWiring() runtime check in GameManager
- [ ] Document wiring test pattern in testing guidelines
- [ ] Add wiring tests to CI pipeline gate

**Done When**:
- All existing presenter pairs have wiring tests
- Runtime verification catches missing wiring on startup
- CI fails if wiring tests are missing for new presenters
- Documentation explains the wiring test pattern

**Depends On**: None (can start immediately)

**Tech Lead Analysis** (2025-09-07):
- **Complexity Score**: 4/10 (Well-understood problem with clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Similar to DI container validation pattern
- **Risk**: None - purely additive safety measures
- **ROI**: HIGH - Prevents hours of debugging for minutes of test writing
- **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-09-07 15:57):
- **DEFERRED TO BACKUP** - Combat mechanics take priority
- Important infrastructure but not blocking core game loop
- Revisit after VS_002 and VS_010a/b/c are complete

 **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation
