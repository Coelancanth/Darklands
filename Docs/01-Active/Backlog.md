## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üí° Ideas (Future Work)
*Future features, nice-to-haves, deferred work*

### TD_006: Refactor Test Scene Actor Tracking (Position Query Warnings)
**Status**: Proposed | **Owner**: Tech Lead | **Size**: S (<4h) | **Priority**: Ideas
**Markers**: [TECHNICAL-DEBT] [TEST-SCENE-ONLY]

**What**: Eliminate position query warnings for dead actors in test scene by dynamically tracking living actors instead of hardcoded ActorIds.

**Why**:
- Test scene currently queries hardcoded `_goblinId`, `_orcId` even after death
- GetActorPositionQueryHandler logs warnings (expected behavior, but noisy)
- Warnings are harmless but clutter logs during testing

**Problem Context** (VS_020 Death Handling Bug):
- Dead actors removed from `IActorPositionService` ‚úÖ
- Test scene's `UpdateActorVisibility()` still queries all 3 actors (player, goblin, orc)
- Dead goblin query fails ‚Üí Warning logged: "Failed to get position for actor 3855cc70..."
- Happens 3x per FOV update (OnFOVCalculated, RestoreCellColor, UpdateActorVisibility)

**Current Behavior**:
```csharp
// TurnQueueTestSceneController.cs
private ActorId _goblinId;  // Hardcoded, never removed when actor dies
private ActorId _orcId;

private void OnFOVCalculated(...) {
    var goblinPosResult = await _mediator.Send(new GetActorPositionQuery(_goblinId));  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Fails if dead
    var orcPosResult = await _mediator.Send(new GetActorPositionQuery(_orcId));
    // ...
}
```

**Proposed Solution**:
```csharp
// Track living actors dynamically
private HashSet<ActorId> _enemyActors = new() { goblinId, orcId };

// Remove on death (subscribe to ActorDiedEvent or check position query success)
private void OnActorDied(ActorId actorId) {
    _enemyActors.Remove(actorId);
}

// Query only living actors
foreach (var enemyId in _enemyActors) {
    var posResult = await _mediator.Send(new GetActorPositionQuery(enemyId));
    // ...
}
```

**Alternative Solutions**:
1. **Downgrade log level**: Change `LogWarning` ‚Üí `LogDebug` in GetActorPositionQueryHandler (loses production debugging value)
2. **Suppress in test scene**: Catch failures silently (current behavior already does this, just logs warning)
3. **Dynamic tracking** (recommended): Remove dead actor IDs from tracking set

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Cleaner logs during testing
- ‚úÖ More realistic production actor tracking pattern
- ‚ùå Requires event subscription (ActorDiedEvent) or position query success tracking
- ‚ùå Only affects test scene (production will have proper actor lifecycle management)

**Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Refactor TurnQueueTestSceneController to track living actors dynamically
- ‚úÖ Subscribe to death events or check position query results
- ‚úÖ Remove dead actor IDs from tracking set
- ‚ùå Change GetActorPositionQueryHandler logging (keep warnings for production debugging)

**Done When**:
- Test scene runs without position query warnings for dead actors
- Dead enemies still disappear from grid correctly
- Combat mode still exits when last enemy dies
- Code demonstrates production-ready actor lifecycle pattern

**Dependencies**: None (VS_020 complete, bug fixed, warnings are cosmetic)

**Tech Lead Decision**:
- **Priority**: Ideas (non-blocking, test scene only)
- **Defer until**: Pattern needed for production actor management (VS_011 Enemy AI?)
- **Alternative**: Accept warnings as "test scene limitation" (harmless, confirms death handling works)

## üìã Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** ‚Üí üî• Critical
2. **Current milestone?** ‚Üí üìà Important  
3. **Everything else** ‚Üí üí° Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes ‚Üí Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with üî• priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
