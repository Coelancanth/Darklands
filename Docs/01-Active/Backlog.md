## üî¢ Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 002
- **Next TD**: 020  
- **Next VS**: 011 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*



### TD_018: Create Integration Tests for MediatR Event Routing [TESTING] [Score: 75/100]
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: M (1 day)
**Priority**: Important (Prevent future incidents like TD_012)
**Markers**: [TESTING] [INTEGRATION] [MEDIATR] [UI]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 16:40
**What**: Create integration tests covering complete event flow from domain to UI
**Why**: TD_012 incident showed unit tests with mocks don't catch DI lifecycle issues
**Problem Statement**:
- Current tests only cover individual components with mocks
- MediatR event routing to UI is not covered by automated tests
- Critical UI functionality only discovered broken during manual testing
- Need end-to-end validation of event publishing and handler invocation
**How**:
- Create test scenarios that publish domain events
- Verify events are received by UI handlers
- Test with actual DI container (not mocks)
- Include parallel execution tests to catch static state issues
**Done When**:
- Integration tests cover ActorDiedEvent ‚Üí UI removal
- Integration tests cover ActorDamagedEvent ‚Üí health bar updates  
- Tests run with real MediatR pipeline and DI container
- Test suite catches event routing failures before manual testing
**Depends On**: TD_017 (proper architecture first)

### TD_013: Extract Test Data from Production Presenters [SEPARATION] [Score: 85/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (3-4h)
**Priority**: Critical (Test code in production)
**Markers**: [SEPARATION-OF-CONCERNS] [TESTING]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 14:42

**What**: Remove hardcoded test actor creation from ActorPresenter
**Why**: Production code contains test/demo data, violating separation of concerns

**Problem Statement**:
- ActorPresenter.InitializeTestPlayer() creates hardcoded test actors
- Static TestPlayerId field exposes test state
- Presenter creating domain objects violates SRP
- Makes it impossible to start with different scenarios

**How**:
- Create IActorFactory service for actor creation
- Move test setup to separate TestScenarioService
- Inject scenario service only in development/test builds
- Use application commands to create actors properly

**Done When**:
- No test data in ActorPresenter
- Actor creation through proper application services
- Test scenarios injectable via configuration
- Clean separation between production and test code

**Depends On**: None

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-08 14:45):
- **APPROVED WITH HIGH PRIORITY** - Test data in production is serious anti-pattern
- Violates Clean Architecture separation of concerns
- Solution: IActorFactory + TestScenarioService pattern is correct
- Enables flexible scenario testing and maintains boundaries
- Route to Dev Engineer (implement after TD_012)

## üóÑÔ∏è Backup (Complex Features for Later)
*Advanced mechanics postponed until core loop is proven fun*

### TD_007: Presenter Wiring Verification Protocol [ARCHITECTURE] [Score: 70/100]
**Status**: Proposed ‚Üê MOVED TO BACKUP 2025-09-07 15:57 (Product Owner priority decision)
**Owner**: Tech Lead (Architecture decision needed)
**Size**: M (4-6h including tests and documentation)
**Priority**: Deferred (Focus on combat mechanics first)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TESTING] [POST-MORTEM-ACTION]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 13:36

**What**: Establish mandatory wiring verification protocol for all presenter connections
**Why**: TD_005 post-mortem revealed 2-hour debug caused by missing GridPresenter‚ÜíActorPresenter wiring

**Problem Statement** (from Post-Mortem lines 58-64):
- GridPresenter wasn't calling ActorPresenter.HandleActorMovedAsync()
- Silent failure - no compile error, no runtime error, just missing behavior
- Manual wiring in GameManager is error-prone and untested

**Proposed Solution**:
1. **Mandatory Wiring Tests**: Every presenter pair MUST have wiring verification tests
2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Consider IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
3. **Runtime Verification**: Add VerifyWiring() method called in GameManager._Ready()
4. **Test Pattern**: Create WiringAssert helper for consistent wiring test assertions

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create presenter wiring test suite (PresenterCoordinationTests.cs)
- [ ] Add IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
- [ ] Implement VerifyWiring() runtime check in GameManager
- [ ] Document wiring test pattern in testing guidelines
- [ ] Add wiring tests to CI pipeline gate

**Done When**:
- All existing presenter pairs have wiring tests
- Runtime verification catches missing wiring on startup
- CI fails if wiring tests are missing for new presenters
- Documentation explains the wiring test pattern

**Depends On**: None (can start immediately)

**Tech Lead Analysis** (2025-09-07):
- **Complexity Score**: 4/10 (Well-understood problem with clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Similar to DI container validation pattern
- **Risk**: None - purely additive safety measures
- **ROI**: HIGH - Prevents hours of debugging for minutes of test writing
- **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-09-07 15:57):
- **DEFERRED TO BACKUP** - Combat mechanics take priority
- Important infrastructure but not blocking core game loop
- Revisit after VS_002 and VS_010a/b/c are complete

 **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SOLID]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 14:42

**What**: Split IGridStateService and IActorStateService into query/command interfaces
**Why**: Large interfaces violate Interface Segregation Principle

**How**:
- Split IGridStateService ‚Üí IGridQueryService + IGridCommandService
- Split IActorStateService ‚Üí IActorQueryService + IActorCommandService
- Update all consumers to use appropriate interface
- Maintain backward compatibility with composite interface

**Done When**:
- Separate query and command interfaces
- Each interface has single responsibility
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Clear separation of read/write operations

**Depends On**: None

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-08 14:45):
- **DEFERRED TO BACKUP** - Valid but not urgent
- Score understated (actually 70/100 due to breaking change risk)
- Not blocking current work, risk outweighs benefit now
- When implemented: use composite interfaces for backward compatibility
- Revisit after critical items complete

### TD_017: Implement UI Event Bus Architecture [ARCHITECTURE] [Score: 65/100] ‚úÖ
**Status**: Done
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: L (2-3 days)
**Priority**: Critical (Foundation for 200+ future events)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [ADR-010] [EVENT-BUS] [MEDIATR]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 16:40
**Completed**: 2025-09-08 19:38

**What**: Implement UI Event Bus pattern to replace static event router
**Why**: Current static approach won't scale to 200+ events and violates SOLID

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** (All 4 Phases + 5 Critical Issues Fixed):

**Phase 1-4: Core Architecture** ‚úÖ
- Created complete UI Event Bus architecture with IUIEventBus interface
- Implemented UIEventForwarder<T> for automatic MediatR event forwarding
- Built WeakReference-based subscription system preventing memory leaks
- Integrated EventAwareNode base class for Godot lifecycle management

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
1. **MediatR Auto-Discovery Conflict** - Removed old GameManagerEventRouter entirely
2. **Missing Base Class Calls** - Fixed base._Ready() and base._ExitTree() calls
3. **Race Condition** - Restructured initialization order (DI first, then EventBus)
4. **CallDeferred Misuse** - Simplified to direct invocation (already on main thread)
5. **Duplicate Registration** - Removed manual UIEventForwarder registration

**Final Architecture**:
```
Domain Event ‚Üí MediatR ‚Üí UIEventForwarder<T> ‚Üí UIEventBus ‚Üí GameManager ‚Üí UI Update
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Health bars update correctly when actors take damage
- ‚úÖ Dead actors removed from UI immediately
- ‚úÖ No more static router errors
- ‚úÖ All 232 tests passing with zero warnings
- ‚úÖ Modern event-driven architecture fully operational

### TD_019: Fix embody script squash merge handling with hard reset strategy ‚úÖ
**Status**: Done
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer  
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important (Developer friction)
**Markers**: [DEVOPS] [AUTOMATION] [GIT]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 17:00
**Completed**: 2025-09-08 17:31

**What**: Fix embody.ps1 script's squash merge handling with simplified reset strategy
**Why**: Script fails when PRs are squash merged, causing sync failures and manual intervention

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**:
1. **Hard Reset Strategy**: Modified Handle-MergedPR() in sync-core.psm1 to use `git reset --hard origin/main` instead of problematic `git pull origin main --ff-only`
2. **Enhanced Pre-push**: Added dotnet format verification/auto-fix to pre-push hook to prevent verify-local-fixes CI failures
3. **Safety Preserved**: Maintains existing stash/restore logic for uncommitted changes
4. **Zero Friction Achieved**: Eliminates manual `git reset --hard origin/main` interventions

**Impact Delivered**:
- ‚úÖ Squash merge handling works without sync failures
- ‚úÖ Persona switching flows smoothly after PR merges  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced format verification prevents CI failures
- ‚úÖ Saves ~5-10 minutes per PR merge per developer
- ‚úÖ branch-status-check.ps1 remains functional for awareness

**DevOps Engineer Decision** (2025-09-08 17:31):
