# Darklands Development Backlog


**Last Updated**: 2025-09-07 14:33

**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> 📚 See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## 🔢 Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 001
- **Next TD**: 010  
- **Next VS**: 009 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter → Use that number → Increment the counter → Update timestamp

## 📖 How to Use This Backlog

### 🧠 Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | → Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | → Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ← Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ← Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

## 🔥 Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### TD_007: Presenter Wiring Verification Protocol [ARCHITECTURE] [Score: 70/100]
**Status**: Proposed ← CREATED 2025-09-07 13:36 (Post-mortem learning)
**Owner**: Tech Lead (Architecture decision needed)
**Size**: M (4-6h including tests and documentation)
**Priority**: Critical (Prevents future 2+ hour debugging sessions)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TESTING] [POST-MORTEM-ACTION]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 13:36

**What**: Establish mandatory wiring verification protocol for all presenter connections
**Why**: TD_005 post-mortem revealed 2-hour debug caused by missing GridPresenter→ActorPresenter wiring

**Problem Statement** (from Post-Mortem lines 58-64):
- GridPresenter wasn't calling ActorPresenter.HandleActorMovedAsync()
- Silent failure - no compile error, no runtime error, just missing behavior
- Manual wiring in GameManager is error-prone and untested

**Proposed Solution**:
1. **Mandatory Wiring Tests**: Every presenter pair MUST have wiring verification tests
2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Consider IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
3. **Runtime Verification**: Add VerifyWiring() method called in GameManager._Ready()
4. **Test Pattern**: Create WiringAssert helper for consistent wiring test assertions

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create presenter wiring test suite (PresenterCoordinationTests.cs)
- [ ] Add IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
- [ ] Implement VerifyWiring() runtime check in GameManager
- [ ] Document wiring test pattern in testing guidelines
- [ ] Add wiring tests to CI pipeline gate

**Done When**:
- All existing presenter pairs have wiring tests
- Runtime verification catches missing wiring on startup
- CI fails if wiring tests are missing for new presenters
- Documentation explains the wiring test pattern

**Depends On**: None (can start immediately)

**Tech Lead Analysis** (2025-09-07):
- **Complexity Score**: 4/10 (Well-understood problem with clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Similar to DI container validation pattern
- **Risk**: None - purely additive safety measures
- **ROI**: HIGH - Prevents hours of debugging for minutes of test writing
- **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

## 📈 Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*


## 🗄️ Backup (Complex Features for Later)
*Advanced mechanics postponed until core loop is proven fun*

### TD_006: Re-enable Smooth Movement Animation [Score: 50/100]
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (Low priority implementation)
**Size**: S (2-4h)
**Priority**: Low (Visual Polish)
**Markers**: [ENHANCEMENT] [ANIMATION] [UI-POLISH]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 12:37

**What**: Re-enable tween-based smooth movement animation for actors
**Why**: Current implementation uses instant position changes; smooth animation improves game feel

**Problem Details**:
- Tween animation fails silently in deferred call context
- No error messages but animation doesn't execute
- Tween.Finished callback never triggers
- Currently using direct position assignment as workaround

**Technical Approach Options**:
1. Fix tween execution in CallDeferred context
2. Use Godot's AnimationPlayer node instead of tweens
3. Implement frame-based lerping in _Process method
4. Create coroutine-based movement system

**Done When**:
- Actor moves smoothly over 0.3s to target position
- Animation works reliably in all contexts
- No visual jumping or stuttering
- Maintains current functionality

**Depends On**: None - Enhancement to existing working system

**[Tech Lead] Decision** (2025-09-07 13:58):
- **APPROVED with LOW PRIORITY**
- Complexity: 2/10 - Simple timing fix
- Solution: await process_frame before tween
- Implement only after core logic complete
- ~2 hour task when time permits

## 📋 Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** → 🔥 Critical
2. **Current milestone?** → 📈 Important  
3. **Everything else** → 💡 Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes → Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with 🔥 priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
