- **Next VS**: 015 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ‚Üê Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ‚Üê Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

#### üö® CRITICAL: VS Items Must Include Architectural Compliance Check
```markdown
**Architectural Constraints** (MANDATORY for VS items):
‚ñ° Deterministic: Uses IDeterministicRandom for any randomness (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Save-Ready: Entities use records and ID references (ADR-005)  
‚ñ° Time-Independent: No wall-clock time, uses turns/actions (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Integer Math: Percentages use integers not floats (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Testable: Can be tested without Godot runtime (ADR-006)
```

## üîó Dependency Chain Analysis

**EXECUTION ORDER**: Following this sequence ensures no item is blocked by missing dependencies.


## üöÄ Ready for Immediate Execution

*Items with no blocking dependencies, approved and ready to start*

### TD_062: Fix Actor Sprite Clipping Through Obstacles During Animation
**Status**: Approved - Ready for Dev
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (2.5h revised estimate)
**Priority**: High - Visual bug breaking immersion
**Created**: 2025-09-17 20:45 (Dev Engineer)
**Updated**: 2025-09-17 19:35 (Tech Lead - Approved with sub-cell waypoint solution)
**Markers**: [ANIMATION] [PATHFINDING] [VISUAL-BUG]

**What**: Prevent actor sprites from visually passing through walls/obstacles during movement
**Why**: Current linear interpolation causes sprites to overlap impassable terrain

**Problem Statement**:
- Actor animates linearly between grid cells
- When path goes around a corner, sprite cuts through the obstacle
- Example: Path goes (0,0) ‚Üí (1,0) ‚Üí (1,1), but sprite moves diagonally through wall at (1,0)
- Breaks visual consistency and immersion

**Visual Example**:
```
Current (WRONG):        Should Be (CORRECT):
‚ñà = Wall                ‚ñà = Wall
P = Player              P = Player
. = Path dot            ‚Üí = Movement

‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà                   ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
‚ñà...‚ñà  Player moves     ‚ñà‚Üí‚Üí.‚ñà  Player follows
‚ñà.P.‚ñà  diagonally       ‚ñà‚ÜìP.‚ñà  the actual path
‚ñà...‚ñà  through wall     ‚ñà...‚ñà  around the wall
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà                   ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
```

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-17 19:35):
**APPROVED - Sub-Cell Waypoint Solution**

**Architectural Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Aligns with ADR-006: Animation stays in View layer (no abstraction)
- ‚úÖ Uses approved "Animation Event Bridge" pattern from ADR-006
- ‚úÖ Integrates with ADR-010 UIEventBus for completion events
- ‚úÖ Maintains perfect logic/rendering decoupling

**Selected Solution: Sub-Cell Waypoints with Callbacks**
- Generate intermediate waypoints when path changes direction
- Add waypoints at 30% offset from cell center at corners
- Implement IMovementAnimationEvents for precise callback control
- Callbacks fire when reaching actual grid cells (not sub-waypoints)

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Phase 1 (30m)**: Create IMovementAnimationEvents interface in Core/Application
2. **Phase 2 (45m)**: Add GenerateSmoothedPath() with corner detection to ActorView
3. **Phase 3 (45m)**: Integrate callbacks with tween system
4. **Phase 4 (30m)**: Test and tune waypoint offsets

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Sub-cell offset: TileSize * 0.3f (tunable)
- Detect corners: (prev.X != next.X) && (prev.Y != next.Y)
- Callbacks at cell boundaries, not waypoints
- UIEventBus publishes MovementCompletedEvent

**Complexity Score**: 3/10 - Following established patterns
**Pattern Match**: ADR-006 Animation Event Bridge pattern
**Risk**: Low - Pure presentation layer change

**Dependencies**:
- Requires TD_060 (Movement Animation) - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- Coordinate with TD_061 (Camera Follow) - can be done in parallel

### TD_061: Camera Follow During Movement Animation
**Status**: Not Started
**Owner**: Unassigned
**Size**: S (1-2h estimate)
**Priority**: High - UX improvement
**Created**: 2025-09-17 20:35 (Dev Engineer)
**Markers**: [CAMERA] [MOVEMENT] [UX]

**What**: Make camera follow player smoothly during movement animation
**Why**: Currently camera only updates on click destination, not during movement

**Problem Statement**:
- Player moves cell-by-cell with smooth animation (TD_060 complete)
- Camera jumps to destination immediately on click
- Player can move off-screen during animation
- Poor UX when moving long distances

**Proposed Solution**:
1. GridView subscribes to actor position updates during animation
2. Camera smoothly interpolates to follow actor
3. Optional: Camera leads slightly ahead on path for better visibility
4. Ensure camera doesn't jitter with tween updates

**Technical Approach**:
- Hook into ActorView's tween updates
- Update camera position per frame or per cell
- Use smooth camera interpolation (lerp)
- Consider viewport boundaries
