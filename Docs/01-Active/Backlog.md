## üî¢ Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 002
- **Next TD**: 031  
- **Next VS**: 011 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ‚Üê Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ‚Üê Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

#### üö® CRITICAL: VS Items Must Include Architectural Compliance Check
```markdown
**Architectural Constraints** (MANDATORY for VS items):
‚ñ° Deterministic: Uses IDeterministicRandom for any randomness (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Save-Ready: Entities use records and ID references (ADR-005)  
‚ñ° Time-Independent: No wall-clock time, uses turns/actions (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Integer Math: Percentages use integers not floats (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Testable: Can be tested without Godot runtime (ADR-006)
```

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### TD_018: Integration Tests for C# Event Infrastructure [TESTING] [Score: 65/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important (Prevent DI/MediatR integration failures)
**Markers**: [TESTING] [INTEGRATION] [MEDIATR] [EVENT-BUS]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 16:40
**Approved**: 2025-09-08 20:15

**What**: Integration tests for MediatR‚ÜíUIEventBus pipeline WITHOUT Godot runtime
**Why**: TD_017 post-mortem revealed 5 cascade failures that pure C# integration tests could catch

**Problem Statement**:
- TD_017 incident had 5 failures, 3 were pure C# infrastructure issues
- Current unit tests with mocks don't catch DI lifecycle problems
- MediatR auto-discovery conflicts not covered by tests
- WeakReference cleanup behavior untested
- Thread safety of event bus never validated

**Integration Test Definition** (for this codebase):
> Tests that verify REAL interaction between C# components (MediatR, UIEventBus, UIEventForwarder, DI container) WITHOUT mocking these infrastructure pieces, but WITHOUT requiring Godot runtime.

**Scope** (C# Infrastructure Only):
1. **MediatR Pipeline Tests**
   - Real MediatR ‚Üí UIEventForwarder ‚Üí UIEventBus flow
   - Handler auto-discovery validation
   - No duplicate handler registration
   
2. **DI Container Tests**
   - Service lifetime verification (singleton vs transient)
   - Registration conflict detection
   - Container initialization order
   
3. **UIEventBus Infrastructure**
   - WeakReference cleanup with mock subscribers (not Godot nodes)
   - Concurrent event publishing thread safety
   - Multiple subscriber scenarios
   
4. **NOT Testing** (Requires GDUnit/Manual):
   - Actual Godot node lifecycle
   - CallDeferred thread marshalling  
   - UI presenter updates
   - Scene tree integration

**Done When**:
- Integration test suite covers C# event infrastructure
- Tests use real DI container and MediatR pipeline (no mocks)
- Concurrent publishing scenarios validated
- WeakReference memory management verified
- All tests run in CI without Godot dependency
- Would have caught 3/5 issues from TD_017 incident

**Depends On**: None (TD_017 already complete)

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-08 20:15):
- **APPROVED WITH FOCUSED SCOPE** - Pure C# integration tests only
- 80% value for 20% complexity (no Godot runtime needed)
- Catches critical DI/MediatR issues that caused TD_017 incident
- Defer Godot UI testing to future GDUnit initiative
- Test Specialist should implement immediately after current work

### TD_013: Extract Test Data from Production Presenters [SEPARATION] [Score: 40/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (2-3h)
**Priority**: Critical (Test code in production)
**Markers**: [SEPARATION-OF-CONCERNS] [SIMPLIFICATION]
**Created**: 2025-09-08 14:42
**Revised**: 2025-09-08 20:35

**What**: Extract test actor creation to simple IActorFactory
**Why**: ActorPresenter contains 90+ lines of hardcoded test setup, violating SRP

**Problem Statement**:
- ActorPresenter.InitializeTestPlayer() creates hardcoded test actors
- Static TestPlayerId field exposes test state globally
- Presenter directly creating domain objects violates Clean Architecture
- 90+ lines of test initialization code in production presenter

**How** (SIMPLIFIED APPROACH):
- Create simple IActorFactory interface with CreatePlayer/CreateDummy methods
- Factory internally uses existing MediatR commands (follow SpawnDummyCommand pattern)
- Each scene handles its own initialization in _Ready()
- Remove ALL test code from ActorPresenter
- NO TestScenarioService needed (over-engineering)

**Implementation**:
```csharp
// Simple factory interface
public interface IActorFactory
{
    Task<Fin<ActorId>> CreatePlayerAsync(Position position, string name = "Player");
    Task<Fin<ActorId>> CreateDummyAsync(Position position, int health = 50);
}

// Scene decides what it needs
public override void _Ready() 
{
    await _actorFactory.CreatePlayerAsync(new Position(0, 0));
    await _actorFactory.CreateDummyAsync(new Position(5, 5));
}
```

**Done When**:
- No test initialization code in presenters
- IActorFactory handles all actor creation via commands
- Each scene initializes its own actors
- Static TestPlayerId completely removed
- Clean separation achieved with minimal complexity

**Depends On**: None

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-08 20:35):
- **REVISED TO SIMPLER APPROACH** - TestScenarioService is over-engineering
- Simple IActorFactory + scene-driven init is sufficient
- Follows YAGNI principle - don't build what we don't need
- Reduces complexity from 85/100 to 40/100
- Same result, half the code, easier to maintain
