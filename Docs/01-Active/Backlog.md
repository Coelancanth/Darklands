### TD_063: Layered Game State Management
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED (See ADR-023)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (implement per ADR-023)
**Size**: M (6h for complete implementation)
**Priority**: High - Foundational system needed before AI turns
**Created**: 2025-09-17 21:55 (Dev Engineer - initial proposal)
**Updated**: 2025-09-17 22:30 (Tech Lead - ADR-023 created with layered architecture)
**Markers**: [STATE-MACHINE] [FOUNDATION] [ARCHITECTURE] [ADR-023]

**What**: Implement input state management to lock user interactions during ongoing work operations
**Why**: Users can currently click/interact while animations, commands, or other work is in progress, causing conflicts and inconsistent state

**Problem Statement**:
- User can click tiles while actor is moving, causing command queuing issues
- Input events can interrupt ongoing operations (attacks, movement, etc.)
- No visual feedback when system is "busy" vs ready for input
- Race conditions between user input and system state changes

**Technical Approach** (State Machine Pattern):
- Create `IInputStateManager` service in Application layer
- State machine with states: `Ready`, `Processing`, `Animating`, `Disabled`
- Each state defines what input events are allowed/blocked
- Presenter layer queries state before processing user input
- Visual feedback shows when input is locked (cursor changes, UI graying, etc.)

**Architectural Constraints**:
‚ñ° Deterministic: State changes based on clear triggers, not timing
‚ñ° Save-Ready: State can be serialized if needed for save games
‚ñ° Time-Independent: Uses game events not wall-clock time
‚ñ° Integer Math: N/A for this feature
‚ñ° Testable: State machine logic testable without Godot runtime

**State Transition Examples**:
```
Ready ‚Üí Processing: User clicks move command
Processing ‚Üí Animating: Command validated, animation starts
Animating ‚Üí Ready: Animation complete event received
Ready ‚Üí Disabled: Dialog/menu opens
Disabled ‚Üí Ready: Dialog/menu closes
```

**TECH LEAD FINAL DESIGN** (2025-09-17 22:30):
‚úÖ **APPROVED - See ADR-023 for Complete Architecture**

**Why Layered State System**:
- **Layer 1**: Game flow (MainMenu, InGame, Victory)
- **Layer 2**: Combat states (PlayerTurn, AITurn, Executing)
- **Layer 3**: UI overlays (Dialog, Inventory, Targeting)
- Handles concurrent states elegantly
- Foundation for entire game's state management

**Implementation per ADR-023**:
```csharp
public enum GameState
{
    PlayerTurn,         // Can accept input
    AnimatingAction,    // Blocking input during animation
    AITurn,            // AI thinking
    DialogOpen,        // Modal UI active
    TargetingMode      // Selecting target
}

public interface IGameStateManager
{
    GameState CurrentState { get; }
    bool CanProcessInput { get; }
    bool TransitionTo(GameState newState);
}

// Usage in Presenter
if (!_stateManager.CanProcessInput) return;
```

**Phased Implementation**:
1. **Phase 1** (2h): Core state manager with basic states
2. **Phase 2** (1h): Integration with command handlers
3. **Phase 3** (1h): UI feedback (cursor changes)
4. **Phase 4** (2h): Testing and state validation

**Complexity Score**: 4/10 (balanced approach)
**Time Estimate**: 4-6h (foundational system)
**Pattern Match**: Standard FSM pattern, used in all tactical games

**Done When**:
- [ ] IGameStateManager interface and implementation
- [ ] Basic states defined (PlayerTurn, AnimatingAction, AITurn minimum)
- [ ] State transitions validated (can't go from AITurn to TargetingMode)
- [ ] Integration with command handlers
- [ ] Presenters check CanProcessInput before accepting input
- [ ] Cursor changes based on state
- [ ] GameStateChangedEvent published on transitions
- [ ] Unit tests for valid/invalid transitions

**Dependencies**: Complements TD_061 perfectly (state changes when movement starts/ends)
**Enables**: TD_064 (provides input state management for movement redirection)

### TD_061: Progressive FOV Updates During Movement
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED (Option D with refinements)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (ready to implement)
**Size**: M (4-6h with movement progression service)
**Priority**: Critical - Game mechanic bug
**Created**: 2025-09-17 20:35 (Dev Engineer - initial proposal)
**Updated**: 2025-09-17 22:09 (Tech Lead - Approved Option D with refinements)
**Markers**: [FOV] [VISION] [MOVEMENT] [GAME-LOGIC] [ARCHITECTURE]

**What**: Update Field of View progressively as actor moves cell-by-cell
**Why**: Currently FOV updates instantly to destination, revealing areas before actor arrives

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED** (Dev Engineer Ultra-Analysis):
**Root Cause**: `GridPresenter.cs:236` - FOV updates after entire move completes
```csharp
// CURRENT BROKEN FLOW:
var result = await _mediator.Send(moveCommand);  // Move completes instantly
result.Match(
    Succ: async _ => {
        await UpdatePlayerVisionAsync(_currentTurn);  // FOV reveals destination immediately!
    }
);
```

**Visual Example**:
```
Current (WRONG):              Expected (CORRECT):
Turn 1: Click destination     Turn 1: Click destination
  ####?                         ####?
  #@..?  <- FOV shows           #@..?  <- FOV at start
  #...?     destination         #...?     position only
  ????      immediately         ????

Turn 2: Actor animating       Turn 2: Actor at cell 1
  ####.                         ####?
  #...@  <- Actor still         #.@.?  <- FOV updates
  #....     moving but          #...?     per cell
  ....      FOV already         ???       progressively
            revealed all
```

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE WITH TECH LEAD'S OPTION A**:

‚ùå **Couples Game Logic to Animation Timing**
- FOV updates driven by animation callbacks
- Game state becomes dependent on visual timing
- Violates Clean Architecture separation
- Creates save/load complexity (animation state in saves?)
- Makes testing require animation system

**DEV ENGINEER COUNTER-PROPOSAL: Option D - Logical Movement Progression** ‚≠ê

**Core Principle**: **Separate logical position from visual position completely**

```csharp
// 1. Domain Layer - Pure logical movement
public interface ILogicalMovementService
{
    Fin<Unit> StartMovement(ActorId actorId, IEnumerable<Position> path);
    // Advances position cell-by-cell on fixed 200ms timer
    // Publishes ActorLogicalPositionChanged events
}

// 2. Application Layer - FOV responds to logical events
public class ActorLogicalPositionChangedEventHandler
{
    public async Task Handle(ActorLogicalPositionChangedEvent evt, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Calculate FOV for new logical position
        var fovQuery = CalculateFOVQuery.Create(evt.ActorId, evt.NewPosition, range, turn);
        await _mediator.Send(fovQuery);
        // Publish VisionStateChanged for UI updates
    }
}

// 3. Presentation Layer - Animation syncs to logical position
public class MovementAnimator
{
    public void OnLogicalPositionChanged(ActorLogicalPositionChangedEvent evt)
    {
        // Smoothly animate sprite toward new logical position
        // Animation is purely cosmetic, doesn't affect game state
    }
}
```

**Enhanced Flow**:
1. **User clicks** ‚Üí `MoveActorCommand` with full path
2. **Command calculates path** ‚Üí Starts logical movement timer (200ms/cell)
3. **Logical position advances** ‚Üí FOV updates immediately per cell
4. **Animation follows** ‚Üí Smooth visual movement toward logical position
5. **User sees** ‚Üí Progressive FOV revelation matching logical progression

**Architectural Advantages vs Tech Lead's Option A**:

‚úÖ **Perfect Clean Architecture**: Game logic completely separate from animation
‚úÖ **Fully Deterministic**: Fixed 200ms timing, independent of animation framerate
‚úÖ **Save-Safe**: Logical position + timer state = complete game state
‚úÖ **Testable**: FOV updates testable without any Godot animation
‚úÖ **Performance**: FOV calculated every 200ms, not every animation frame
‚úÖ **Robust**: Animation can pause/stutter without affecting game logic

**Architectural Constraints**:
‚ñ° Deterministic: Fixed 200ms timer timing, rule-based progression ‚úÖ
‚ñ° Save-Ready: Logical position + timer = serializable game state ‚úÖ
‚ñ° Time-Independent: Uses fixed intervals, not wall-clock time ‚úÖ
‚ñ° Integer Math: 200ms intervals, deterministic timing ‚úÖ
‚ñ° Testable: Complete FOV logic testable without Godot runtime ‚úÖ

**Implementation Plan** (4-6h estimate):

**Phase 1: Domain Logic** (1.5h)
- Create `ILogicalMovementService` with timer-based position advancement
- Add `ActorLogicalPositionChanged` domain event
- Unit tests for logical movement timing

**Phase 2: Application Integration** (2h)
- Create event handler linking logical position ‚Üí FOV updates
- Modify `MoveActorCommandHandler` to use logical movement service
- Integration tests for FOV progression

**Phase 3: Presentation Sync** (1.5h)
- Update `MovementAnimator` to sync with logical position events
- Ensure smooth visual animation toward logical position
- Manual testing for user experience

**Phase 4: Edge Cases** (1h)
- Handle interruptions (new commands during movement)
- Save/load during movement
- Animation performance optimization

**Dev Engineer Assessment**:
- **Complexity Score**: 6/10 - Cross-layer but architecturally pure
- **Maintainability**: Excellent - clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Outstanding - game logic completely unit testable
- **Robustness**: Superior - animation issues cannot break game state

**TECH LEAD APPROVAL** (2025-09-17 22:09):
‚úÖ **APPROVED - Option D with refinements** (See **ADR-022: Logical-Visual Position Separation**)

**Technical Assessment**:
- **Pattern Match**: Client-server pattern adapted for single-player - EXCELLENT
- **Architecture**: Maintains perfect Clean Architecture boundaries
- **Reusability**: Sets foundation for ALL progression systems (combat, abilities)
- **Complexity Adjustment**: 5/10 (not 6) - Well-known pattern, straightforward implementation
- **ADR Created**: ADR-022 documents the Logical-Visual Position Separation pattern

**Required Refinements** (ENHANCED after ultra-analysis):
1. **Better Naming**: `IFogOfWarRevealService` (crystal clear purpose)
2. **Two-Position Model**: Logical/Visual positions separated (simplified from three)
3. **Game-Time Based**: Not wall-clock, for pause/save support
4. **Configurable Timing**: `MillisecondsPerCell` property (default 200ms)
5. **Pattern Documentation**: Standard for ALL timed progressions

**Why Not Simpler?**
Considered waypoint events in command handler - rejected because:
- Blocks handler during movement
- Can't handle interruptions cleanly
- Mixes timing into business logic
- Makes testing require async delays

**Enhanced Implementation Approach** (Ultra-Analysis Complete):
```csharp
// Core service interface (Application layer)
// Implements ADR-022: Logical-Visual Position Separation
public interface IFogOfWarRevealService
{
    Position GetCurrentRevealPosition(ActorId actorId);
    void StartRevealProgression(ActorId id, Path path);
    void AdvanceTime(int gameMilliseconds);
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Name clearly states purpose (fog reveal, not movement)
- Two-position model keeps it simple
- Game-time based for determinism
- Handles interruptions cleanly
- Optimizable with batch updates

**Implementation Note**: Start with Phase 1 (Domain) immediately - no blockers

**Dependencies**: None (can be implemented independently)
**Enables**: TD_064 (Interruptible Movement - extends with cancellation support)

**Recommendation**: Implement Option D for superior architecture and maintainability

**Phase 1 Complete** (2025-09-18 17:24):
‚úÖ Tests: 13/13 passing (19ms execution)

**What I Actually Did**:
- Implemented pure domain layer with zero external dependencies
- Created FogOfWar namespace (renamed from Movement to avoid conflicts)
- Built timer-based RevealProgression value object with immutable advancement logic
- Added comprehensive domain events: RevealPositionAdvanced, RevealProgressionStarted/Completed
- Converted tests from NUnit to Xunit/FluentAssertions to match existing patterns

**Problems Encountered**:
- Namespace collision: "Movement" namespace conflicted with existing Domain.Grid.Movement class
  ‚Üí Solution: Renamed to FogOfWar namespace, more descriptive and avoids collision
- Test framework mismatch: Initially used NUnit but existing tests use Xunit
  ‚Üí Solution: Converted to Xunit with FluentAssertions for consistency
- Domain purity violation: Initially tried to use MediatR in domain events
  ‚Üí Solution: Made domain events pure data structures, MediatR integration in Application layer

**Technical Debt Created**:
- None - Pure domain implementation with excellent test coverage

**Lessons for Phase 2**:
- Application layer will need MediatR notification wrappers for domain events
- Service interface should be named IFogOfWarRevealService for clarity
- Timer advancement will need game-time integration, not wall-clock time

## üìã Blocked - Waiting for Dependencies

*Items that cannot start until blocking dependencies are resolved*

### TD_064: Interruptible Movement System
**Status**: Proposed - BLOCKED by TD_061 (Phase 2-4) and TD_063
**Owner**: Tech Lead (review) ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement)
**Size**: S (2-3h for implementation)
**Priority**: Important - Enhanced player experience
**Created**: 2025-09-18 20:15 (Tech Lead - architectural analysis complete)
**Markers**: [MOVEMENT] [INPUT] [STATE-COORDINATION] [BLOCKED]

**What**: Enable cancellation and redirection of movement while in progress
**Why**: Players expect to change destination mid-movement for responsive controls

**Problem Statement**:
- Currently no way to cancel movement once started
- Players must wait for movement to complete before issuing new command
- Feels unresponsive compared to modern tactical games
- Path recalculation from partial position unclear

**Technical Approach** (Hard Cancel Pattern):
```csharp
public class MovementRedirectHandler
{
    public Fin<Unit> HandleMovementRedirect(ActorId actorId, Position newDest)
    {
        // 1. Check input state allows redirect (TD_063)
        if (!_inputStateManager.AllowsMovementRedirect())
            return Fail("Input locked");

        // 2. Check game state allows redirect (ADR-023)
        if (!_gameStateManager.CanExecuteMovementCommand())
            return Fail("Invalid state");

        // 3. Cancel at current logical position
        var currentPos = _movementService.CancelMovement(actorId);

        // 4. Recalculate and start new path
        var newPath = _pathfinding.CalculatePath(currentPos, newDest);
        return _movementService.StartMovement(actorId, newPath);
    }
}
```

**System Coordination Required**:
- **TD_061**: Provides movement progression mechanics (HOW to redirect)
- **TD_063**: Controls input acceptance (IF redirect allowed)
- **ADR-023**: Validates game state (WHEN redirect valid)
- **VS_014**: A* pathfinding from discrete logical position

**Why "Hard Cancel" Approach**:
- **Simplest**: Always at discrete cell (logical position)
- **Deterministic**: No sub-cell interpolation math
- **Testable**: Clear state at all times
- **Save-friendly**: Position always well-defined

**Rejected Alternatives**:
- **Smooth Redirect**: Complex state tracking for marginal UX gain
- **Sub-cell Interpolation**: A* requires discrete cells, not fractional positions
- **Command Queuing**: Feels laggy for movement (OK for abilities)

**Architectural Constraints**:
‚òë Deterministic: Cancel at discrete logical position
‚òë Save-Ready: Clear position state at all times
‚òë Time-Independent: Based on logical position not animation
‚òë Integer Math: Grid positions only
‚òë Testable: State transitions without Godot

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **MovementProgressionService**: Add `CancelMovement()` method
2. **InputStateManager**: Configure `ProcessingMove` to allow redirects
3. **GameStateManager**: Validate redirect during `PlayerTurn`
4. **GridPresenter**: Handle new click during movement
5. **Tests**: Cancellation, state validation, edge cases

**Complexity Score**: 3/10 (straightforward with clear patterns)
**Pattern Match**: Common in tactical games (XCOM, Divinity, BG3)

**Done When**:
- [ ] Movement can be cancelled mid-path
- [ ] New destination triggers path recalculation
- [ ] State validation prevents invalid redirects
- [ ] Visual feedback shows redirect occurred
- [ ] Edge cases handled (same cell, no path, etc.)
- [ ] Unit tests for state coordination

**Dependencies**: TD_061 (movement progression), TD_063 (input states), ADR-023 (game states)
