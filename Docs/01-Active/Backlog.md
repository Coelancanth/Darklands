## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### TD_024: Basin Detection & Inner Sea Depth System
**Status**: Proposed (Foundation for VS_030 water body classification)
**Owner**: Tech Lead
**Size**: M (6-8h)
**Priority**: Ideas (prerequisite for VS_030 Phase 1)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [WORLDGEN] [REFACTORING]

**What**:

**Why**: VS_030 requires basin metadata (pour points, water surface elevation, boundaries) to classify ocean vs inner seas. Current code only calculates ocean depth; inner seas need depth maps for thalweg pathfinding cost function.

**How**:

**Done When**:


**Depends On**: TD_023 ‚úÖ (pit-filling basin preservation complete)

**Blocks**: VS_030 Phase 1 (water body classification needs basin metadata)

## üìà Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

### VS_030: Inner Sea Flow via Lake Thalweg Pathfinding
**Status**: Proposed (Requires TD_021 foundation)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: L (14-18h)
**Priority**: Important (fixes D-8 flow topology for inner seas)
**Markers**: [WORLDGEN] [ALGORITHM] [PATHFINDING] [HYDRAULIC-EROSION]

**What**: Implement Dijkstra-based pathfinding to compute river thalweg (deepest channel) paths through inner seas, enabling correct D-8 flow topology for landlocked water bodies.

**Why**:
- **D-8 Problem**: Inner seas are flat surfaces (elevation < sea level) ‚Üí D-8 has no gradient ‚Üí becomes sink ‚Üí breaks flow accumulation
- **Current State**: Rivers terminate incorrectly at inner sea boundaries (flow "stuck" at lakes like Caspian Sea)
- **Physical Reality**: Rivers flow THROUGH lakes along deepest channels (thalweg) to outlets, not terminate at inlets
- **Pathfinding Solution**: Pre-compute optimal paths (inlet ‚Üí outlet) using depth-based cost, hard-code flow directions for inner sea cells
- **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: Water body classification MUST happen AFTER pit-filling (pit-filling DEFINES lakes with boundaries/water level/outlets)

**How** (5-phase implementation with CORRECT pipeline order):

**Phase 1: Water Body Classification from Pit-Filling Results** (3-4h)
- **CRITICAL**: This happens AFTER pit-filling, which DEFINES lakes hydrologically
- Create `WaterBodyMasks.cs` DTOs (OceanMask, InnerSeaMask, InnerSeaRegions)
- Implement `WaterBodyClassifier.ClassifyFromPitFilling()`:
  - Input: FilledHeightmap + OriginalHeightmap + PitFillingMetadata (basins identified by pit-filling)
  - Algorithm:
    - For each basin from pit-filling (has boundary, water surface elevation, pour point):
      - If pour point at sea level AND connected to map edges ‚Üí Ocean
      - If pour point above sea level OR landlocked ‚Üí Inner Sea
    - Group inner seas into regions (connected components)
    - Detect inlets: Boundary cells where land D-8 flow enters lake
    - Detect outlet: The pour point identified by pit-filling
  - Output: WaterBodyMasks (ocean mask, inner sea mask, inner sea regions with inlets/outlets)
- Why this works: Pit-filling already solved the "leaky lake" and "archipelago of sinks" problems by finding pour points

**Phase 2: Lake Thalweg Pathfinder** (3-4h)
- Implement `LakeThalwegPathfinder.ComputePaths()` (Dijkstra with depth-based cost)
- Cost function: `Cost = 1 / (lakeSurfaceElevation - originalHeightmap[cell] + Œµ)` ‚Üí Prefers deeper water
- For each inner sea region (from Phase 1):
  - For each inlet ‚Üí Find path to outlet (Dijkstra)
  - Result: List of path segments (x, y, nextX, nextY)
- Output: `Dictionary<InnerSeaId, List<PathSegment>>` (thalweg paths for all inner seas)
- Optimization: Use BFS/distance transform to pre-compute "flow to nearest thalweg" for non-path lake cells

**Phase 3: Hybrid Flow Direction Calculator** (2-3h)
- Modify `FlowDirectionCalculator.CalculateWithThalwegs()`:
  - Land cells: D-8 steepest descent (unchanged)
  - Ocean cells: dir = -1 (sink)
  - Inner sea cells ON thalweg path: Use pre-computed direction from pathfinding
  - Inner sea cells NOT on thalweg: Flow toward nearest thalweg cell (from Phase 2 optimization)
- Result: Hybrid flow directions (D-8 + pathfinding + sinks)

**Phase 4: Pipeline Integration** (2-3h)
- **CORRECTED PIPELINE ORDER**:
  ```
  Stage 2: Pit-filling (FIRST - DEFINES lakes)
    ‚Üí Output: FilledHeightmap + PitFillingMetadata (basins with pour points)

  Stage 2.5 (NEW): Water Body Classification
    ‚Üí Input: FilledHeightmap + OriginalHeightmap + PitFillingMetadata
    ‚Üí Output: WaterBodyMasks (ocean/inner sea + regions with inlets/outlets)

  Stage 2.6 (NEW): Thalweg Pathfinding
    ‚Üí Input: InnerSeaRegions (from Stage 2.5)
    ‚Üí Output: ThalwegPaths (Dijkstra-computed paths)

  Stage 3 (MODIFIED): Hybrid Flow Direction Calculator
    ‚Üí Input: FilledHeightmap + WaterBodyMasks + ThalwegPaths
    ‚Üí Output: FlowDirections (D-8 + thalweg + sinks)

  Stage 4-5: Topological Sort + Flow Accumulation (unchanged)
  ```
- Update `PitFillingCalculator` to expose basin metadata (pour points, boundaries)
- Update `WorldGenerationResult` to include `WaterBodyMasks` and `ThalwegPaths`
- Wire through to rendering

**Phase 5: Visualization and Testing** (3-4h)
- Add view modes:
  - `OceanMask`: Show ocean cells (blue)
  - `InnerSeaMask`: Show inner sea cells (teal/cyan - distinguish from ocean)
  - `LakeThalwegs`: Show computed paths through inner seas (red lines on water)
  - `ThalwegDepths`: Heat map of lake depths (deeper=red, shallow=blue)
- Unit tests: Water classification correctness (ocean vs inner sea after pit-filling)
- Unit tests: Pathfinding finds valid paths (inlet ‚Üí outlet)
- Visual validation: Flow accumulation shows rivers flowing THROUGH inner seas
- Visual validation: Thalweg paths curve naturally (follow deepest channels)
- Performance testing: Total overhead <50ms (classification + pathfinding)

**Done When**:
1. ‚úÖ Pit-filling exposes basin metadata (pour points, boundaries, water surface elevations)
2. ‚úÖ `WaterBodyClassifier` classifies basins AFTER pit-filling (ocean vs inner sea)
3. ‚úÖ Inner sea regions have correct inlets (where land flow enters) and outlets (pour points)
4. ‚úÖ `LakeThalwegPathfinder` computes depth-based paths for all inner sea regions
5. ‚úÖ Dijkstra cost function uses depth (prefers thalweg channels)
6. ‚úÖ `FlowDirectionCalculator` hybrid approach works (D-8 + thalweg + sinks)
7. ‚úÖ Flow accumulation shows rivers passing THROUGH inner seas (not terminating at boundaries)
8. ‚úÖ 4 new view modes render correctly (OceanMask, InnerSeaMask, LakeThalwegs, ThalwegDepths)
9. ‚úÖ Unit tests: Pathfinding correctness (finds paths, follows depth gradient)
10. ‚úÖ Visual validation: No "leaky lake" errors (all classified lakes are true basins per pit-filling)
11. ‚úÖ All existing tests GREEN (no regression)
12. ‚úÖ Performance: <50ms total overhead for 512√ó512 map (~5-10 inner seas)

**Depends On**:
- TD_021 ‚úÖ (must be complete - provides SSOT constant and normalized scale)
- TD_023 ‚úÖ (must be complete - provides basin metadata for water classification)
- VS_029 ‚úÖ (flow visualization exists for validation)

**Blocks**: Nothing (hydraulic erosion foundation - enables future particle erosion)

**Enables**:
- Future particle-based erosion (rivers erode along thalweg paths)
- Future sediment deposition (sediment accumulates in deep lake basins)
- Future navigation system (ships follow thalweg channels)

**Dev Engineer Decision** (2025-10-13 18:38):
- **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: Original VS_030 had water classification BEFORE pit-filling ‚Üí CAUSALITY INVERSION ERROR
- **Key Insight from tmp.md**:
  - "Pit-filling is not just filling - it's a DEFINITION tool"
  - Pour point defines outlet, pour point elevation defines water surface, basin below pour point defines lake boundary
  - Cannot classify "what is a lake?" before pit-filling answers this question
- **Correct Order**: Pit-filling (defines) ‚Üí Classify (ocean vs inner sea) ‚Üí Pathfind (thalweg) ‚Üí Flow calculation (hybrid)
- **Leaky Lake Prevention**: Classifying from pit-filling results prevents misclassifying river valleys as lakes
- **Archipelago Prevention**: Pit-filling already merged micro-sinks into coherent basins with single pour points
- **Size Increase**: 14-18h (was 12-16h) due to Phase 1 added (water classification moved from TD_021)
- **Approach Still Valid**: Pathfinding over land bridge (excellent visual quality + reusable paths)
- **Next Step**: Implement TD_021 (foundation), expose pit-filling metadata, then implement VS_030 with correct pipeline

## üí° Ideas (Future Work)
*Future features, nice-to-haves, deferred work*



### VS_033: MVP Item Editor (Weapons + Armor Focus)
**Status**: Proposed (Build AFTER manual item creation phase)
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement)
**Size**: L (15-20h)
**Priority**: Ideas (deferred until designer pain validated)
**Markers**: [TOOLING] [DESIGNER-UX]

**What**: Minimal viable Godot EditorPlugin for creating weapon/armor ItemTemplates with auto-wired i18n and component-based UI.

**Why**:
- **Eliminate CSV pain** - Designer never manually edits CSV files (auto-generates translation keys, auto-syncs en.csv)
- **Component selection UI** - Check boxes for Equippable + Weapon/Armor (vs manual SubResource creation in Inspector)
- **Validation before save** - Catch errors (duplicate keys, missing components) BEFORE runtime
- **80% of content** - Weapons + armor are most items, validates tooling investment

**Strategic Phasing** (do NOT skip ahead):
1. **Phase 1: Validate Pain** (2-4h manual work) - REQUIRED FIRST
   - After VS_032 complete, designer creates 10-20 items manually in Godot Inspector
   - Designer documents pain points: "Inspector tedious", "CSV editing error-prone", "No validation until runtime"
   - **Trigger**: Designer reports "Inspector workflow is too tedious for 20+ items"

2. **Phase 2: Build MVP** (15-20h) - ONLY if Phase 1 pain validated
   - Build EditorPlugin with 5 core features (see "How" below)
   - Focus: Weapons + armor ONLY (defer consumables/tools to Phase 3)
   - Effort: 15-20h (vs 30h full Item Editor by deferring advanced features)

3. **Phase 3: Expand** (when >30 items exist) - Future
   - Add consumables, tools, containers support
   - Add balance tools (DPS calculator, usage tracking)
   - Add batch operations (create 10 variants)

**How** (MVP scope - 5 core features):
1. **Component Selection UI** (3-4h) - Checkboxes: ‚òë Equippable, ‚òë Weapon, ‚òë Armor (auto-show properties)
2. **Quick Templates** (2-3h) - Presets: "Weapon" (Equippable+Weapon), "Armor" (Equippable+Armor), "Shield" (Equippable+Armor+Weapon)
3. **Auto-Wired i18n** (4-5h) - Designer types "Iron Sword" ‚Üí auto-generates ITEM_IRON_SWORD ‚Üí auto-writes en.csv (ZERO manual CSV editing!)
4. **Component Validation** (3-4h) - "Weapon requires Equippable", "Duplicate key ITEM_IRON_SWORD", offer auto-fix
5. **Live Preview** (2-3h) - Show sprite + stats + translation key preview

**Deferred for MVP** (add in Phase 3):
- ‚ùå Balance comparison (DPS calculator, power curves)
- ‚ùå Usage tracking (which ActorTemplates use this item)
- ‚ùå Batch operations (create N variants)
- ‚ùå Consumables/tools support (weapons + armor = 80% of content)

**Done When** (Phase 2 - MVP):
- ‚úÖ Designer creates iron_sword.tres in 2 minutes (vs 5+ minutes Inspector)
- ‚úÖ Component selection via checkboxes (no manual SubResource creation)
- ‚úÖ Zero manual CSV editing (auto-generates ITEM_IRON_SWORD, writes to en.csv)
- ‚úÖ Validation before save (catches duplicate keys, missing components)
- ‚úÖ Works for weapons + armor (can create sword, plate armor, shield)
- ‚úÖ Designer reports: "Item Editor is MUCH faster than Inspector"

**Depends On**:
- VS_032 ‚úÖ (must be complete - validates equipment system works)
- Phase 1 manual item creation (10-20 items) - validates pain is REAL, not hypothetical

**Blocks**: Nothing (tooling is parallel track - doesn't block gameplay features)

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-10-10):
- **Do NOT build until Phase 1 pain validated** - Must create 10-20 items manually first to validate:
  1. Component-based ItemTemplate architecture works (can actors equip items?)
  2. Inspector workflow pain is REAL (not hypothetical)
  3. CSV editing pain is REAL (manual key management sucks)
- **Rationale**: Tools solve REAL pain, not imaginary pain. Must feel pain before building solution.
- **Risk mitigation**: If Phase 1 shows "Inspector is workable", defer Item Editor and create more items (avoid 15-20h investment for low ROI).
- **Scope discipline**: MVP focuses weapons + armor (80% of content). Defer consumables/tools until 30+ items exist (avoid premature generalization).
