# Darklands Development Backlog


**Last Updated**: 2025-09-17 09:58 (Tech Lead - Updated TD_047 with strategic boundaries, TD_056 paired approach, TD_057-059 MediatR fixes)

**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> 📚 See [Workflow.md - Backlog Aging Protocol](Workflow.md#-backlog-aging-protocol---the-3-10-rule) for 3-10 day aging rules

## 🔢 Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 008
- **Next TD**: 060
- **Next VS**: 015 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter → Use that number → Increment the counter → Update timestamp

## 📖 How to Use This Backlog

### 🧠 Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | → Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | → Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ← Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ← Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: VS Items Must Include Architectural Compliance Check
```markdown
**Architectural Constraints** (MANDATORY for VS items):
□ Deterministic: Uses IDeterministicRandom for any randomness (ADR-004)
□ Save-Ready: Entities use records and ID references (ADR-005)  
□ Time-Independent: No wall-clock time, uses turns/actions (ADR-004)
□ Integer Math: Percentages use integers not floats (ADR-004)
□ Testable: Can be tested without Godot runtime (ADR-006)
```

## 🔗 Dependency Chain Analysis

**EXECUTION ORDER**: Following this sequence ensures no item is blocked by missing dependencies.

### TD_056: Paired Logging System Unification
**Status**: APPROVED (Revised)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Revision Date**: 2025-09-17 09:50 (Tech Lead - Approved with paired approach)
**Size**: S (3h total - 2h Phase 1, 1h Phase 2)
**Priority**: Important - Developer Experience
**Created**: 2025-09-17 09:34 (Dev Engineer)
**Revised**: 2025-09-17 09:50 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 4/10 (reduced from 7/10)
**Markers**: [LOGGING] [ARCHITECTURE] [DEVELOPER-EXPERIENCE]

**Problem**: 4 separate logging systems create confusion and duplicate files
**Solution**: Unify into 2 systems respecting the file/console boundary

**Current State → Target State**:
```
CURRENT (4 systems):                    TARGET (2 systems):
1. Serilog → file                  →    Unified File Logger
2. UnifiedCategoryLogger → file     →    (Serilog-based)
3. GodotCategoryLogger → console    →    Unified Console Logger
4. Direct GD.Print() → console      →    (GodotCategory-based)
```

### Phase 1: Unify File-Based Loggers (2h)
**What**: Route UnifiedCategoryLogger through Serilog infrastructure
**Why**: Eliminate duplicate log files, single source for file logging
**Implementation**:
1. Modify UnifiedCategoryLogger to use Serilog as backend
2. Preserve category-based filtering and formatting
3. Single output file: `darklands-{date}.log`
4. Remove separate session log file creation
5. Ensure all existing ICategoryLogger calls still work

### Phase 2: Standardize Console Loggers (1h)
**What**: Create consistent Godot console logging
**Why**: Standardize UI/presentation layer logging
**Implementation**:
1. Create `GodotLogger` static wrapper class
2. Replace all direct `GD.Print()` calls with `GodotLogger.Log()`
3. Add category support to console output
4. Consistent formatting with timestamp and category

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Single log file for all C# domain/infrastructure logging
- [ ] Consistent console output for all Godot logging
- [ ] No file access conflicts (respects sandbox boundary)
- [ ] Existing ICategoryLogger interface unchanged
- [ ] All 664 tests still pass

**Files**: `GameStrapper.cs`, `UnifiedCategoryLogger.cs`, `GodotCategoryLogger.cs`








## 📋 Blocked - Waiting for Dependencies

*Items that cannot start until blocking dependencies are resolved*

### VS_014: A* Pathfinding Foundation
**Status**: Approved - BLOCKED by TD_046
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (3h)
**Priority**: Critical - Foundation for movement system
**Created**: 2025-09-11 18:12
**Updated**: 2025-09-16 01:00 (Tech Lead - Moved to blocked section)
**Markers**: [MOVEMENT] [PATHFINDING] [CHAIN-2-MOVEMENT] [BLOCKED]
**Blocking Dependency**: TD_046 (project structure must be established first)

**What**: Implement A* pathfinding algorithm with visual path display
**Why**: Foundation for VS_012 movement system and all future tactical movement

**DEPENDENCY CHAIN**: Chain 2 - Step 1 (Movement Foundation)
- Blocked by: TD_046 (architectural foundation)

- [ ] Path visualizes on grid before movement
- [ ] Performance <10ms for typical paths (50 tiles)
- [ ] Handles no-path-exists gracefully (returns None)
- [ ] All tests pass including edge cases

**Architectural Constraints**:
☑ Deterministic: Consistent tie-breaking rules
☑ Save-Ready: Paths are transient, not saved
☑ Time-Independent: Pure algorithm
☑ Integer Math: Use 100/141 for movement costs
☑ Testable: Pure domain function

**What**: Movement system where scheduler activates based on vision connections
**Why**: Creates natural tactical combat without explicit modes

**DEPENDENCY CHAIN**: Chain 2 - Step 2 (Vision-Based Movement)
- Blocked by: VS_014 (needs pathfinding for non-adjacent movement)
- Enables: VS_013 (Enemy AI needs movement system)

**Architectural Constraints**:
☑ Deterministic: Fixed TU costs
☑ Save-Ready: Position state only
☑ Time-Independent: Turn-based
☑ Integer Math: Tile movement

**Updated**: 2025-09-16 01:00 (Tech Lead - Moved to blocked section)
**Markers**: [AI] [COMBAT] [CHAIN-2-MOVEMENT] [BLOCKED]
**Blocking Dependency**: VS_012 (Vision-Based Movement System)

**What**: Simple but effective enemy AI for combat testing
**Why**: Need opponents to validate combat system and create gameplay loop

**DEPENDENCY CHAIN**: Chain 2 - Step 3 (Enemy Intelligence)
- Blocked by: VS_012 (AI needs movement system to function)
- Enables: Complete tactical combat gameplay loop

**Architectural Constraints**:
☑ Deterministic: AI decisions based on seeded random

## 📋 Quick Reference

**Dependency Chain Rules:**
- 🚫 **Never** start items with blocking dependencies
- ✅ **Always** complete architectural foundations first
- ⚡ **Parallel** work only when items are in different code areas
- 🔄 **Re-evaluate** priorities after each chain completion

**Work Item Types:**
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes → Tech Lead approves
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates, Tech Lead breaks down
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
