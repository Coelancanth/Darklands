## 🔢 Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 002
- **Next TD**: 012  
- **Next VS**: 011 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter → Use that number → Increment the counter → Update timestamp

## 📖 How to Use This Backlog

### 🧠 Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | → Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | → Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## 🔥 Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### TD_011: Async/Concurrent Architecture Mismatch in Turn-Based Game [ARCHITECTURE]
**Status**: Implementation Complete → Awaiting E2E Validation (Dev Engineer, 2025-09-08)
**Owner**: Dev Engineer (awaiting user testing validation)
**Size**: L (13 hours - 5 phases)
**Priority**: Critical (Fundamental design flaw causing bugs)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [BREAKING-CHANGE] [ROOT-CAUSE]

**What**: Remove async/await patterns from turn-based game flow; implement proper sequential processing
**Why**: Turn-based games are inherently sequential - async creates race conditions and complexity

**Root Cause Analysis** (from BR_001 investigation):
- ActorView uses shared fields (_pendingActorNode, _pendingActorId) with CallDeferred
- Multiple actors created simultaneously overwrite each other's pending data
- Player actor creation gets overwritten by dummy actor creation
- Async Task.Run() calls in presenters violate turn-based sequential nature

**Evidence of Architectural Mismatch**:
```csharp
// CURRENT BROKEN: Concurrent actor creation
Task.Run(async () => await View.DisplayActorAsync(...));  // Actor 1
Task.Run(async () => await View.DisplayActorAsync(...));  // Actor 2 overwrites Actor 1
// Result: Race condition, only last actor displays

// SHOULD BE: Sequential turn-based processing
scheduler.GetNextActor();
ProcessAction();
UpdateUI();  // Synchronous, no race possible
```

**Proposed Architecture**:
1. **Scene Init**: Create ALL actors at once, display them all
2. **Game Loop**: Process turns sequentially (player first, initiative 0)
3. **No Async UI**: All view updates synchronous (Godot auto-updates on data change)
4. **Turn Processing**: One actor → One action → One UI update → Next actor

**Implementation Progress** (Dev Engineer, 2025-09-08):
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Architecture tests added documenting current vs target async patterns
- ✅ **Phase 2**: GameLoopCoordinator created for sequential turn orchestration  
- ✅ **Phase 3**: ALL Task.Run() calls eliminated from ActorPresenter + ExecuteAttackCommandHandler
- ✅ **Phase 4**: ActorView race condition FIXED with queue-based CallDeferred processing
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Build validates async→sync conversion (CS4014 warnings expected/desired)

**Critical Changes Completed**:
- ✅ Removed Task.Run() from all presenters (lines 113, 118, 184, 189) 
- ✅ Fixed shared field race in ActorView with thread-safe queue pattern
- ✅ Sequential processing implemented per ADR-009 specification
- ✅ CS4014 warnings now appear (proves async→sync conversion successful)

**VALIDATION REQUIRED**:
- 🔄 **E2E Testing**: User must verify multiple actors display correctly on scene
- 🔄 **All Tests Pass**: Build must show 0 errors (currently GameLoopCoordinator syntax issues remain)
- 🔄 **Race Condition Resolved**: Player + dummy actors must both be visible simultaneously

**Done When** (Validation Criteria):
- 🔄 **E2E Test**: All actors display correctly on scene start (User validates)
- ✅ **Architecture**: Sequential processing implemented (Dev complete)
- 🔄 **Tests Pass**: Zero build errors, all unit tests passing (Currently: GameLoopCoordinator syntax)  
- ✅ **Race Fixed**: No concurrent Task.Run() causing overwrites (Dev complete)

**READY FOR**: User E2E testing + test suite validation

**Depends On**: None (architectural foundation)

**Debugger Expert Analysis** (2025-09-07 21:21):
- BR_001 was symptom, not cause - removing it as redundant
- Async patterns inappropriate for turn-based games
- MVP separation is correct, implementation is wrong
- Need Tech Lead architecture decision before proceeding

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-07 21:34): **APPROVED WITH URGENCY**
- **Complexity Score**: 7/10 (Well-understood problem, clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Traditional roguelike sequential processing (SPD, NetHack, DCSS)
- **Risk Assessment**: HIGH if not fixed - every feature will fight async pattern
- **ADR-009 Created**: Sequential Turn-Based Processing Pattern documented
- **Solution Validated**: Aligns with Vision.md time-unit combat requirements

**Implementation Phases** (13 hours total):
1. **Phase 1 (2h)**: Verify domain/application synchronous - add architecture tests
2. **Phase 2 (3h)**: Create GameLoopCoordinator for turn orchestration
3. **Phase 3 (4h)**: Remove ALL Task.Run() and async from presenters
4. **Phase 4 (2h)**: Fix ActorView race with proper CallDeferred usage
5. **Phase 5 (2h)**: Integration testing and validation

**Critical Changes Required**:
- Remove Task.Run() from all presenters (lines 113, 118, 184, 189)
- Fix shared field race in ActorView (lines 31-35)
- Make all IView interfaces synchronous
- Implement sequential game loop pattern per ADR-009

**Handoff to Dev Engineer**: This blocks ALL combat work. Implement immediately following ADR-009 pattern.

## 🗄️ Backup (Complex Features for Later)
*Advanced mechanics postponed until core loop is proven fun*

### TD_007: Presenter Wiring Verification Protocol [ARCHITECTURE] [Score: 70/100]
**Status**: Proposed ← MOVED TO BACKUP 2025-09-07 15:57 (Product Owner priority decision)
**Owner**: Tech Lead (Architecture decision needed)
**Size**: M (4-6h including tests and documentation)
**Priority**: Deferred (Focus on combat mechanics first)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TESTING] [POST-MORTEM-ACTION]
**Created**: 2025-09-07 13:36

**What**: Establish mandatory wiring verification protocol for all presenter connections
**Why**: TD_005 post-mortem revealed 2-hour debug caused by missing GridPresenter→ActorPresenter wiring

**Problem Statement** (from Post-Mortem lines 58-64):
- GridPresenter wasn't calling ActorPresenter.HandleActorMovedAsync()
- Silent failure - no compile error, no runtime error, just missing behavior
- Manual wiring in GameManager is error-prone and untested

**Proposed Solution**:
1. **Mandatory Wiring Tests**: Every presenter pair MUST have wiring verification tests
2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Consider IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
3. **Runtime Verification**: Add VerifyWiring() method called in GameManager._Ready()
4. **Test Pattern**: Create WiringAssert helper for consistent wiring test assertions

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create presenter wiring test suite (PresenterCoordinationTests.cs)
- [ ] Add IPresenterCoordinator interface for type-safe wiring
- [ ] Implement VerifyWiring() runtime check in GameManager
- [ ] Document wiring test pattern in testing guidelines
- [ ] Add wiring tests to CI pipeline gate

**Done When**:
- All existing presenter pairs have wiring tests
- Runtime verification catches missing wiring on startup
- CI fails if wiring tests are missing for new presenters
- Documentation explains the wiring test pattern

**Depends On**: None (can start immediately)

**Tech Lead Analysis** (2025-09-07):
- **Complexity Score**: 4/10 (Well-understood problem with clear solution)
- **Pattern Match**: Similar to DI container validation pattern
- **Risk**: None - purely additive safety measures
- **ROI**: HIGH - Prevents hours of debugging for minutes of test writing
- **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-09-07 15:57):
- **DEFERRED TO BACKUP** - Combat mechanics take priority
- Important infrastructure but not blocking core game loop
- Revisit after VS_002 and VS_010a/b/c are complete

 **Decision**: APPROVED for immediate implementation
