## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ‚Üê Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ‚Üê Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

#### üö® CRITICAL: VS Items Must Include Architectural Compliance Check
```markdown
**Architectural Constraints** (MANDATORY for VS items):
‚ñ° Deterministic: Uses IDeterministicRandom for any randomness (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Save-Ready: Entities use records and ID references (ADR-005)  
‚ñ° Time-Independent: No wall-clock time, uses turns/actions (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Integer Math: Percentages use integers not floats (ADR-004)
‚ñ° Testable: Can be tested without Godot runtime (ADR-006)
```

## üîó Dependency Chain Analysis

**EXECUTION ORDER**: Following this sequence ensures no item is blocked by missing dependencies.

### Chain 1: Architecture Foundation (MUST be first)
```
TD_046 ‚Üí (All other work depends on this)
‚îú‚îÄ Enables: Clean separation of concerns
‚îú‚îÄ Enables: Compile-time MVP enforcement
‚îî‚îÄ Blocks: All VS and complex TD items until complete
```

### Chain 2: Movement & Vision System
```
VS_014 (A* Pathfinding) ‚Üí VS_012 (Vision-Based Movement) ‚Üí VS_013 (Enemy AI)
‚îú‚îÄ VS_014: Foundation for all movement
‚îú‚îÄ VS_012: Tactical movement using pathfinding
‚îî‚îÄ VS_013: AI needs movement system to function
```

### Chain 3: Technical Debt Cleanup
```
TD_035 (Error Handling) ‚Üí TD_046 completion
‚îú‚îÄ Can be done in parallel with TD_046
‚îî‚îÄ Should be completed before new feature development
```

### Chain 4: Future Features (After foundations)
```
All IDEA_* items depend on:
‚îú‚îÄ Chain 1 (Architecture) - COMPLETE
‚îú‚îÄ Chain 2 (Movement/Vision) - COMPLETE
‚îî‚îÄ Chain 3 (Technical Debt) - COMPLETE
```

## üöÄ Ready for Immediate Execution

*Items with no blocking dependencies, approved and ready to start*





### TD_054: Dependency Chain Maintenance Protocol
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Tech Lead
**Size**: S (2h)
**Priority**: Important - Planning accuracy
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:32 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 3/10
**Markers**: [PROCESS] [PLANNING]

**What**: Create protocol for maintaining accurate dependency chains in backlog
**Why**: Chains drift out of sync, causing confusion about what's actually blocked

**Protocol Elements**:
1. Weekly dependency review (during planning)
2. Automated chain validation script
3. Clear "blocks/blocked-by" notation
4. Status transitions when dependencies resolve

**Implementation**:
```powershell
./scripts/backlog/validate-dependencies.ps1
# Checks all items for:
# - Broken dependency references
# - Completed blockers not removed
# - Circular dependencies
# - Items marked blocked without blockers
```

**Done When**:
- [ ] Protocol documented in PROTOCOLS.md
- [ ] Validation script created
- [ ] Backlog template updated
- [ ] All current chains validated
- [ ] CI check for PR updates

### TD_050: NetArchTest for Architecture Enforcement
**Status**: Approved - CRITICAL
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: S (4h)
**Priority**: Critical - Prevents architecture violations
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:29 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 4/10
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TESTING] [SAFETY-CRITICAL]

**What**: Add NetArchTest to enforce Clean Architecture boundaries after TD_046
**Why**: Without automated tests, developers can accidentally violate architecture (Domain ‚Üí Infrastructure)

**Scope**:
1. Domain purity tests (no external dependencies)
2. Layer dependency tests (Domain ‚Üê Application ‚Üê Infrastructure)
3. Feature isolation tests (Features don't reference each other)
4. Godot containment tests (Godot types only in main project)

**Done When**:
- [ ] Domain project has zero dependency tests
- [ ] Layer violations fail CI build
- [ ] Feature cross-references are detected
- [ ] Godot type leakage is prevented
- [ ] Tests run in <1s in CI pipeline

**Reference**: TD_046 created the boundaries, this enforces them

### TD_047: Unify Error Handling with LanguageExt
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: M (6-8h)
**Priority**: Important - Debugging complexity
**Created**: 2025-09-16 19:29 (Tech Lead)
**Complexity**: 5/10
**Markers**: [ERROR-HANDLING] [TECHNICAL-DEBT]

**What**: Replace all try-catch blocks with LanguageExt Fin<T> for consistent error handling
**Why**: Mixed error handling (try-catch vs Fin<T>) breaks functional composition and makes debugging harder

**Scope** (System-wide):
1. Infrastructure services (remaining try-catch blocks)
2. Presenters (error propagation to UI)
3. Command handlers (side effect isolation)
4. Godot integration points (thread marshalling errors)

**Done When**:
- [ ] Zero try-catch blocks outside Godot integration boundary
- [ ] All errors flow through Fin<T> pipeline
- [ ] Error aggregation uses LanguageExt combinators
- [ ] Performance unchanged (measure before/after)
- [ ] All 664 tests still pass

**Reference Pattern**: `ExecuteAttackCommandHandler` for Fin<T> usage








## üìã Blocked - Waiting for Dependencies

*Items that cannot start until blocking dependencies are resolved*

**Markers**: [AI] [COMBAT] [CHAIN-2-MOVEMENT] [BLOCKED]
**Blocking Dependency**: VS_012 (Vision-Based Movement System)

**What**: Simple but effective enemy AI for combat testing
**Why**: Need opponents to validate combat system and create gameplay loop

**DEPENDENCY CHAIN**: Chain 2 - Step 3 (Enemy Intelligence)
- Blocked by: VS_012 (AI needs movement system to function)
- Enables: Complete tactical combat gameplay loop

**Architectural Constraints**:
‚òë Deterministic: AI decisions based on seeded random
‚òë Save-Ready: AI state fully serializable
‚òë Time-Independent: Decisions based on game state not time
‚òë Integer Math: All AI calculations use integers
‚òë Testable: AI logic can be unit tested
