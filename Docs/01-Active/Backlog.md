# Darklands Development Backlog


**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10 01:30 (Product Owner: Added VS_033 Item Editor MVP - strategic phasing after manual item creation)

**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> 📚 See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## 🔢 Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 008
- **Next TD**: 019
- **Next VS**: 034


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter → Use that number → Increment the counter → Update timestamp

## 📖 How to Use This Backlog

### 🧠 Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | → Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | → Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ← Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ← Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

## 🔥 Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### VS_032: Equipment Slots System
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner → Tech Lead (breakdown) → Dev Engineer (implement)
**Size**: M (6-8h)
**Priority**: Critical (foundation for combat depth, blocks proficiency/armor/AI)
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [DATA-DRIVEN]

**What**: Equipment slot system (main hand, off hand, head, torso, legs) - actors can equip items from inventory, equipment affects combat.

**Why**:
- **Combat depth NOW** - Equipment defines capabilities (warrior with sword vs bare hands)
- **Build variety** - Heavy armor vs light armor creates different playstyles
- **Unblocks future** - Proficiency (track weapon usage), Ground Loot (enemies drop equipped items), Enemy AI (gear defines enemy capabilities)
- **Foundation** - Stats/armor/proficiency ALL depend on equipment system

**How** (Tech Lead to break down):
- Equipment domain (5 slots: MainHand, OffHand, Head, Torso, Legs)
- EquipItem/UnequipItem commands (move items between inventory ↔ equipment)
- Equipment component (IEquipmentComponent on Actor)
- Data-driven: ActorTemplate.tres pre-equips enemies (goblin spawns with weapon)

**Done When**:
- Warrior can equip sword from inventory → MainHand slot
- Unequip sword → returns to inventory (spatial placement)
- ActorTemplate.tres configures starting equipment (player.tres, goblin.tres)
- Two-handed weapon validation (requires MainHand + OffHand both)
- Equipment visible in UI (EquipmentSlotNode shows equipped items)
- Tests: EquipItem, UnequipItem, two-handed logic, inventory integration (15-20 tests)

**Depends On**: VS_018 ✅ (Spatial Inventory), VS_009 ✅ (Item System)
**Blocks**: Stats/Attributes, Proficiency System, Ground Loot, Enemy AI
**Enables**: Manual item creation phase (10-20 items) → validates VS_033 Item Editor need

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-10-10): Thin scope - Equipment Slots ONLY. Defer stats/attributes/fatigue to separate VS items after this validated. After VS_032 complete, designer creates 10-20 items manually (Phase 1) to validate Item Editor need before building it.

## 💡 Ideas (Future Work)
*Future features, nice-to-haves, deferred work*

### VS_033: MVP Item Editor (Weapons + Armor Focus)
**Status**: Proposed (Build AFTER manual item creation phase)
**Owner**: Product Owner → Tech Lead (breakdown) → Dev Engineer (implement)
**Size**: L (15-20h)
**Priority**: Ideas (deferred until designer pain validated)
**Markers**: [TOOLING] [DESIGNER-UX]

**What**: Minimal viable Godot EditorPlugin for creating weapon/armor ItemTemplates with auto-wired i18n and component-based UI.

**Why**:
- **Eliminate CSV pain** - Designer never manually edits CSV files (auto-generates translation keys, auto-syncs en.csv)
- **Component selection UI** - Check boxes for Equippable + Weapon/Armor (vs manual SubResource creation in Inspector)
- **Validation before save** - Catch errors (duplicate keys, missing components) BEFORE runtime
- **80% of content** - Weapons + armor are most items, validates tooling investment

**Strategic Phasing** (do NOT skip ahead):
1. **Phase 1: Validate Pain** (2-4h manual work) - REQUIRED FIRST
   - After VS_032 complete, designer creates 10-20 items manually in Godot Inspector
   - Designer documents pain points: "Inspector tedious", "CSV editing error-prone", "No validation until runtime"
   - **Trigger**: Designer reports "Inspector workflow is too tedious for 20+ items"

2. **Phase 2: Build MVP** (15-20h) - ONLY if Phase 1 pain validated
   - Build EditorPlugin with 5 core features (see "How" below)
   - Focus: Weapons + armor ONLY (defer consumables/tools to Phase 3)
   - Effort: 15-20h (vs 30h full Item Editor by deferring advanced features)

3. **Phase 3: Expand** (when >30 items exist) - Future
   - Add consumables, tools, containers support
   - Add balance tools (DPS calculator, usage tracking)
   - Add batch operations (create 10 variants)

**How** (MVP scope - 5 core features):
1. **Component Selection UI** (3-4h) - Checkboxes: ☑ Equippable, ☑ Weapon, ☑ Armor (auto-show properties)
2. **Quick Templates** (2-3h) - Presets: "Weapon" (Equippable+Weapon), "Armor" (Equippable+Armor), "Shield" (Equippable+Armor+Weapon)
3. **Auto-Wired i18n** (4-5h) - Designer types "Iron Sword" → auto-generates ITEM_IRON_SWORD → auto-writes en.csv (ZERO manual CSV editing!)
4. **Component Validation** (3-4h) - "Weapon requires Equippable", "Duplicate key ITEM_IRON_SWORD", offer auto-fix
5. **Live Preview** (2-3h) - Show sprite + stats + translation key preview

**Deferred for MVP** (add in Phase 3):
- ❌ Balance comparison (DPS calculator, power curves)
- ❌ Usage tracking (which ActorTemplates use this item)
- ❌ Batch operations (create N variants)
- ❌ Consumables/tools support (weapons + armor = 80% of content)

**Done When** (Phase 2 - MVP):
- ✅ Designer creates iron_sword.tres in 2 minutes (vs 5+ minutes Inspector)
- ✅ Component selection via checkboxes (no manual SubResource creation)
- ✅ Zero manual CSV editing (auto-generates ITEM_IRON_SWORD, writes to en.csv)
- ✅ Validation before save (catches duplicate keys, missing components)
- ✅ Works for weapons + armor (can create sword, plate armor, shield)
- ✅ Designer reports: "Item Editor is MUCH faster than Inspector"

**Depends On**:
- VS_032 ✅ (must be complete - validates equipment system works)
- Phase 1 manual item creation (10-20 items) - validates pain is REAL, not hypothetical

**Blocks**: Nothing (tooling is parallel track - doesn't block gameplay features)

**Product Owner Decision** (2025-10-10):
- **Do NOT build until Phase 1 pain validated** - Must create 10-20 items manually first to validate:
  1. Component-based ItemTemplate architecture works (can actors equip items?)
  2. Inspector workflow pain is REAL (not hypothetical)
  3. CSV editing pain is REAL (manual key management sucks)
- **Rationale**: Tools solve REAL pain, not imaginary pain. Must feel pain before building solution.
- **Risk mitigation**: If Phase 1 shows "Inspector is workable", defer Item Editor and create more items (avoid 15-20h investment for low ROI).
- **Scope discipline**: MVP focuses weapons + armor (80% of content). Defer consumables/tools until 30+ items exist (avoid premature generalization).
