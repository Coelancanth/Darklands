**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-29
> 📚 See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## 🔢 Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 008
- **Next TD**: 041
- **Next VS**: 015 


**Protocol**: Check your type's counter → Use that number → Increment the counter → Update timestamp

## 📖 How to Use This Backlog

### 🧠 Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | → Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | → Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | → Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ← Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ← Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: VS Items Must Include Architectural Compliance Check
```markdown
**Architectural Constraints** (MANDATORY for VS items):
□ Deterministic: Uses IDeterministicRandom for any randomness (ADR-004)
□ Save-Ready: Entities use records and ID references (ADR-005)  
□ Time-Independent: No wall-clock time, uses turns/actions (ADR-004)
□ Integer Math: Percentages use integers not floats (ADR-004)
□ Testable: Can be tested without Godot runtime (ADR-006)
```

## 🔥 Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### TD_040: Extract Diagnostics Bounded Context (Assembly-Based)
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: L (8h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-09-12 14:52
**Updated**: 2025-09-12 15:45
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [DDD]

**What**: Create separate Diagnostics bounded context with assembly boundaries
**Why**: Enables non-deterministic types without violating ADR-004, enforces true isolation

**Problem**: 
- Performance monitoring needs DateTime/double (non-deterministic)
- Namespace-only separation allows accidental coupling
- Using ActorId in Diagnostics violates context isolation
- Need compile-time enforcement of boundaries

**Solution - Assembly-Based Bounded Contexts**:

1. **Phase 1: Create Assembly Structure** (2h)
   ```xml
   <!-- Create separate projects -->
   src/Diagnostics/Darklands.Diagnostics.Domain.csproj
   src/Diagnostics/Darklands.Diagnostics.Application.csproj  
   src/Diagnostics/Darklands.Diagnostics.Infrastructure.csproj
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Use Shared Identity Types** (2h)
   ```csharp
   // SharedKernel - EntityId (NOT ActorId!)
   public readonly record struct EntityId(Guid Value);
   
   // Diagnostics uses EntityId, never ActorId
   public record VisionPerformanceReport(
       DateTime Timestamp,
       Dictionary<EntityId, double> Metrics  // ✅ EntityId not ActorId
   );
   ```

3. **Phase 3: Integration Event Bus** (2h)
   - Separate bus for cross-context events
   - Integration events use primitives only
   - Versioning and correlation IDs

4. **Phase 4: Main Thread Dispatcher** (2h)
   - Implement IMainThreadDispatcher
   - Ensure Godot calls on main thread
   - Update presenters to use dispatcher

**Assembly References**:
```
Darklands.csproj (Main)
├─> Tactical.Application
├─> Diagnostics.Application
├─> Platform.Infrastructure.Godot
└─> SharedKernel

NO cross-context references!
```

**Done When**:
- [ ] Separate assemblies created for Diagnostics
- [ ] Using EntityId instead of ActorId
- [ ] Integration event bus implemented
- [ ] Main thread dispatcher working
- [ ] Architecture tests enforce assembly boundaries
- [ ] No direct references between contexts

**Tech Lead Decision**:
- Assembly boundaries provide compile-time safety
- Dual event bus strategy (MediatR + Integration)
- NO scoped services (Singleton or Transient only)
- See ADR-017 (revised) for complete strategy

### VS_012: Vision-Based Movement System
**Status**: Approved  
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (2h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-09-11 00:10
**Updated**: 2025-09-11
**Tech Breakdown**: Movement using vision for scheduler activation

**What**: Movement system where scheduler activates based on vision connections
**Why**: Creates natural tactical combat without explicit modes

**Design** (per ADR-014):
- **Scheduler activation**: When player and hostiles have vision
- **Movement rules**: Adjacent-only when scheduled, pathfinding otherwise
- **Interruption**: Stop movement when enemy becomes visible
- **Fixed cost**: 100 TU per action when scheduled

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Phase 1**: Domain rules (0.5h)
  - Movement validation (adjacent when scheduled)
  - Fixed TU costs (100)
  
- **Phase 2**: Application layer (0.5h)
  - MoveCommand handler with vision check
  - Route to scheduler vs instant movement
  - Console output for states
  
- **Phase 3**: Infrastructure (0.5h)
  - SchedulerActivationService
  - PathfindingService integration
  - Movement interruption handler
  
- **Phase 4**: Integration (0.5h)
  - Wire to existing scheduler
  - Console messages and turn counter
  - Test with multiple scenarios

**Scheduler Activation (Solo)**:
```csharp
bool ShouldUseScheduler() {
    // Solo player - only check player vs monsters
    return monsters.Any(m => 
        m.State != Dormant && 
        (visionService.CanSee(player, m) || visionService.CanSee(m, player))
    );
}
```

**Movement Flow**:
```csharp
if (ShouldUseScheduler()) {
    // Tactical movement
    if (!Position.IsAdjacent(from, to)) {
        return "Only adjacent moves when enemies visible";
    }
    scheduler.Schedule(new MoveAction(actor, to, 100));
} else {
    // Instant travel with interruption check
    foreach (var step in path) {
        actor.Position = step;
        if (ShouldUseScheduler()) {
            return "Movement interrupted - enemy spotted!";
        }
    }
}
```

**Console Examples**:
```
// No vision - instant
> move to (30, 30)
[Traveling...]
You arrive at (30, 30)

// Vision exists - tactical
> move to (10, 10)
[Enemies visible - tactical movement]
> move north
[Turn 1] You move north (100 TU)
[Turn 2] Goblin moves west (100 TU)

// Interruption
> move to (50, 50)
[Traveling...]
Movement interrupted at (25, 25) - Orc spotted!
```

**Done When**:
- Scheduler activates on vision connections
- Adjacent-only when scheduled
- Pathfinding when not scheduled
- Movement interrupts on new vision
- Turn counter during tactical movement
- Clear console messages

**Architectural Constraints**:
☑ Deterministic: Fixed TU costs
☑ Save-Ready: Position state only
☑ Time-Independent: Turn-based
☑ Integer Math: Tile movement
☑ Testable: Clear state transitions

**Depends On**: 
- VS_011 (Vision System) - ✅ Infrastructure foundation complete (Phase 3)
- VS_014 (A* Pathfinding) - ⏳ Required for non-adjacent movement
**Next Step**: Implement VS_014 first, then begin VS_012


### VS_014: A* Pathfinding Foundation
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Dev Engineer  
**Size**: S (3h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-09-11 18:12
**Tech Breakdown**: Complete by Tech Lead

**What**: Implement A* pathfinding algorithm with visual path display
**Why**: Foundation for VS_012 movement system and all future tactical movement

**Implementation Plan**:

**Phase 1: Domain Algorithm (1h)**
- Create `Domain.Pathfinding.AStarPathfinder`
- Pure functional implementation with no dependencies
- Deterministic tie-breaking (use Position.X then Y for equal F-scores)
- Support diagonal movement (8-way) with correct costs (100 ortho, 141 diagonal)
- Handle blocked tiles from Grid.Tile.IsWalkable

```csharp
public static class AStarPathfinder
{
    public static Option<ImmutableList<Position>> FindPath(
        Position start,
        Position goal,
        Grid grid,
        bool allowDiagonal = true)
    {
        // A* with deterministic tie-breaking
        // Returns None if no path exists
    }
}
```

**Phase 2: Application Service (0.5h)**
- Create `IPathfindingService` interface in Core
- `FindPathQuery` and handler for CQRS pattern
- Cache recent paths for performance (LRU cache, 32 entries)

**Phase 3: Infrastructure (0.5h)**
- Implement `PathfindingService` with caching
- Performance monitoring (target: <10ms for 50 tiles)
- Path validation before returning

**Phase 4: Presentation (1h)**
- Path visualization in GridPresenter
- Semi-transparent overlay tiles (blue for path, green for destination)
- Update on mouse hover to show potential paths
- Clear path display on movement/action

**Visual Feedback Design**:
```
Path tile: Modulate(0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5) - Semi-transparent blue
Destination: Modulate(0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.7) - Semi-transparent green  
Current hover: Updates in real-time as mouse moves
Animation: Gentle pulse on destination tile
```

**Done When**:
- A* finds optimal paths deterministically
- Diagonal movement works correctly (1.41x cost)
- Path visualizes on grid before movement
- Performance <10ms for typical paths (50 tiles)
- Handles no-path-exists gracefully (returns None)
- All tests pass including edge cases

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Straight line path (no obstacles)
2. Path around single wall
3. Maze navigation
4. No path exists (surrounded)
5. Diagonal preference when optimal

**Architectural Constraints**:
☑ Deterministic: Consistent tie-breaking rules
☑ Save-Ready: Paths are transient, not saved
☑ Time-Independent: Pure algorithm
☑ Integer Math: Use 100/141 for movement costs
☑ Testable: Pure domain function

**Dependencies**: None (foundation feature)
**Blocks**: VS_012 (Movement System)

*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

<!-- TD_031 moved to permanent archive (2025-09-10 21:02) - TimeUnit TU refactor completed successfully -->


### TD_032: Fix Namespace-Class Collisions (Grid.Grid, Actor.Actor)
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (4h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-09-11
**Complexity**: 2/10
**ADR**: ADR-015

**What**: Refactor namespace structure to eliminate collisions
**Why**: Current `Domain.Grid.Grid` and `Domain.Actor.Actor` patterns force verbose code and confuse developers

**Implementation Plan** (per ADR-015):
1. **Domain Layer** (2h):
   - Rename `Grid` → `WorldGrid` in new `Domain.Spatial` namespace
   - Move `Actor` to `Domain.Entities` namespace
   - Reorganize into bounded contexts: Spatial, Entities, TurnBased, Perception
   
2. **Application/Infrastructure** (1h):
   - Update all imports and references
   - No structural changes, just namespace updates
   
3. **Tests** (1h):
   - Update test imports
   - Verify all tests pass

**Done When**:
- No namespace-class collisions remain
- All tests pass without warnings
- Architecture fitness tests validate structure
- IntelliSense shows clear suggestions

**Technical Notes**:
- Single atomic PR for entire refactoring
- No behavior changes, pure reorganization
- Follow bounded context pattern from ADR-015





### TD_039: Fix Application→Infrastructure Boundary Violations
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Owner**: Dev Engineer → Completed
**Size**: S (2h) → Actual: 2.5h
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-09-12 13:59
**Updated**: 2025-09-12 14:52
**Complexity**: 2/10
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE]

**What**: Fix inverted dependencies where Application layer references Infrastructure
**Why**: Violates Clean Architecture - dependencies should flow inward, not outward

**✅ Implementation Complete** (Dev Engineer 2025-09-12):

**Fixed Violations** (4/5):
1. ✅ `ActorFactory.cs` → Removed `Infrastructure.Debug`, uses `Domain.Debug.ICategoryLogger`
2. ✅ `InMemoryGridStateService.cs` → Removed `Infrastructure.Identity`, refactored to use DI for `IStableIdGenerator`
3. ✅ `GameLoopCoordinator.cs` → Removed `Infrastructure.Debug`, uses `Domain.Debug.ICategoryLogger`
4. ✅ `UIEventForwarder.cs` → Removed `Infrastructure.Debug`, uses `Domain.Debug.ICategoryLogger`

**Key Fixes Implemented**:
- **Service Locator Fix**: Refactored `InMemoryGridStateService` constructor to receive `IStableIdGenerator` via dependency injection instead of using `GuidIdGenerator.Instance`
- **Architecture Test Enhancement**: Updated `Application_Should_Not_Reference_Infrastructure` test to actively fail on violations (was previously just logging)
- **Clean Import Removal**: Eliminated all redundant Infrastructure imports where Domain interfaces were available

**⚡ Tech Lead Decision** (2025-09-12 14:52):
**REJECTED Option B (Domain Interface Pattern)** - Violates ADR-004 Deterministic Simulation!

The real issue isn't the boundary violation - it's that `VisionPerformanceReport` contains:
- `DateTime` (wall clock time) 
- `double` for timing measurements
- Non-deterministic performance metrics

Per ADR-004, these CANNOT exist in Domain layer as they break determinism.

**Solution**: Move the shared types to Domain BUT refactor them first:
1. Replace `DateTime` with turn/action counts
2. Replace `double` timings with integer microseconds  
3. Make metrics deterministic (tile counts, cache hits as integers)

This maintains Clean Architecture AND determinism. The types belong in Domain as they're shared contracts, but must be deterministic.

**Follow-up**: Create TD_040 to refactor VisionPerformanceReport for determinism, then move to Domain.


### TD_035: Standardize Error Handling in Infrastructure Services
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (3h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-09-11 18:07
**Complexity**: 3/10

**What**: Replace remaining try-catch blocks with Fin<T> in infrastructure services
**Why**: Inconsistent error handling breaks functional composition and makes debugging harder

**Scope** (LIMITED TO):
1. **PersistentVisionStateService** (7 try-catch blocks):
   - GetVisionState, UpdateVisionState, ClearVisionState methods
   - Convert to Try().Match() pattern with Fin<T>
   
2. **GridPresenter** (3 try-catch in event handlers):
   - OnActorSpawned, OnActorMoved, OnActorRemoved
   - Wrap in functional error handling
   
3. **ExecuteAttackCommandHandler** (mixed side effects):
   - Extract logging to separate methods
   - Isolate side effects from business logic

**NOT IN SCOPE** (critical boundaries):
- Performance-critical loops in ShadowcastingFOV (keep imperative)
- ConcurrentDictionary in caching (proven pattern, don't change)
- Working switch statements (already readable)
- Domain layer (already fully functional)

**Implementation Guidelines**:
```csharp
// Pattern to follow:
public Fin<T> ServiceMethod() =>
    Try(() => 
    {
        // existing logic
    })
    .Match(
        Succ: result => FinSucc(result),
        Fail: ex => FinFail<T>(Error.New("Context-specific message", ex))
    );
```

**Done When**:
- Zero try-catch blocks in listed services
- All errors flow through Fin<T> consistently
- Side effects isolated into dedicated methods
- Performance unchanged (measure before/after)
- All existing tests still pass

**Tech Lead Notes**:
- This is about consistency, not FP purity
- Keep changes mechanical and predictable
- Don't get creative - follow existing patterns
- If performance degrades, revert that specific change
