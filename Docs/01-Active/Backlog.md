### TD_006: Fix Godot Terrain Autotiling - Investigate Symmetric Bitmask Bug
**Status**: Proposed | **Owner**: Dev Engineer | **Size**: M (4-8h) | **Priority**: Nice-to-Have (Quality)
**Markers**: [TECHNICAL-DEBT] [TESTING] [ROOT-CAUSE-ANALYSIS] [GODOT-ENGINE]

**What**: Investigate and fix root cause of Godot terrain autotiling failure for symmetric wall bitmasks, replacing manual tile assignment workaround with proper data-driven autotiling

**Current State** (VS_019_FOLLOWUP workaround):
- Manual position-based tile assignment in `RenderWallsWithAutotiling()` (lines 180-242)
- Works correctly but hardcodes edge/corner logic (not data-driven)
- Problem: Godot's `SetCellsTerrainConnect()` picks wrong tile variants for left/right edges

**Symptom**:
- Left edge (X=0) and right edge (X=29) both rendered with atlas (3,1) "wall_middle_right"
- Expected: Left edge should use (0,1) "wall_middle_left", right edge uses (3,1)
- Visual result: Asymmetric appearance (seam/gap on left wall)

**Hypothesis** (needs testing):
- **Symmetric bitmask patterns** cause ambiguity in Godot's terrain matching algorithm
- Both edges have identical neighbor counts (3 walls, 1 floor) but different directional patterns
- Godot terrain system may require **asymmetric bitmask hints** to distinguish mirrored edges
- Alternative: TileSet configuration might be missing directional metadata

**Root Cause Investigation Plan**:

**Phase 1: Understand Godot Terrain System** (2h)
- [ ] Read Godot 4.x terrain autotiling documentation (official docs + community resources)
- [ ] Study peering bit semantics: Does `right_side` mean "connects to terrain on right" or "is edge facing right"?
- [ ] Test simple case: 2√ó2 grid with one terrain type, observe which tiles Godot picks
- [ ] Document expected behavior vs actual behavior with diagrams

**Phase 2: Isolate Minimal Reproduction** (1-2h)
- [ ] Create isolated test scene with ONLY walls (no floor/grass/trees)
- [ ] Test with single edge: Does left-only wall pick correct tile?
- [ ] Test with two edges: Do symmetric edges both fail?
- [ ] Compare to working example: Right edge renders correctly - why?
- [ ] Document exact conditions that trigger wrong tile selection

**Phase 3: Test TileSet Configuration Variations** (2h)
- [ ] **Test 1**: Remove peering bits from one edge tile ‚Üí does autotiling fail gracefully?
- [ ] **Test 2**: Add directional custom data (e.g., `edge_direction: "left"`) ‚Üí does Godot use it?
- [ ] **Test 3**: Create asymmetric bitmasks (left has 3 bits, right has 4) ‚Üí does this fix selection?
- [ ] **Test 4**: Try `SetCellsTerrainPath()` instead of `SetCellsTerrainConnect()` ‚Üí different algorithm?
- [ ] Document which configurations produce correct results

**Phase 4: Root Cause Identification** (1h)
- [ ] Analyze test results to pinpoint exact failure mode
- [ ] Possible root causes to validate:
  - **Godot bug**: Terrain matching algorithm has edge case for symmetric patterns
  - **Bitmask design**: Our configuration is valid but Godot needs additional hints
  - **API misuse**: We're calling SetCellsTerrainConnect incorrectly (wrong params/order)
  - **TileSet limitation**: Godot terrain system doesn't support symmetric edge tiles
- [ ] Write detailed root cause analysis with evidence from tests

**Phase 5: Implement Proper Fix** (2h)
- [ ] **If TileSet config fix**: Update test_terrain_tileset.tres with correct bitmask patterns
- [ ] **If API usage fix**: Refactor RenderWallsWithAutotiling() to use proper Godot API
- [ ] **If Godot limitation**: Document limitation, keep manual assignment (accept tech debt)
- [ ] **If Godot bug**: File upstream bug report with minimal reproduction, use workaround
- [ ] Remove manual tile assignment code if autotiling works
- [ ] Update documentation with findings and solution

**Success Criteria**:
- Root cause fully understood and documented with test evidence
- One of these outcomes:
  1. **Best**: Autotiling works correctly via TileSet/API fix, manual code deleted
  2. **Good**: Confirmed Godot limitation, manual workaround justified with explanation
  3. **Acceptable**: Godot bug filed upstream, workaround documented as temporary
- Knowledge captured for future terrain autotiling work

**Non-Goals**:
- Supporting complex interior wall autotiling (out of scope - border walls only)
- Performance optimization (manual assignment is already fast)
- Visual improvements beyond fixing symmetry

**Benefits**:
- **Data-driven**: Designers can add new terrain edges without C# code changes
- **Maintainable**: Autotiling handles edge cases automatically (T-junctions, corners, etc.)
- **Extensible**: Solution applies to future terrain types (ice walls, lava edges, etc.)
- **Educational**: Deep understanding of Godot terrain system benefits team

**Risks**:
- **MEDIUM**: May discover Godot terrain system has fundamental limitations
- **LOW**: Significant time investment for polish feature (not blocking core gameplay)
- **MITIGATION**: Timebox investigation to 8 hours, accept workaround if no solution found

**Dependencies**: None (VS_019 + VS_019_FOLLOWUP complete, walls functional)

**Defer Conditions** (when to skip):
- Phase 1 validation reveals this is critical path work (move to VS_020 Combat instead)
- Investigation exceeds 8 hour timebox without clear solution
- Godot terrain system fundamentally can't handle symmetric edges (accept tech debt)

### VS_020: Basic Combat System (Attacks & Damage)
**Status**: Approved | **Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer | **Size**: M (1-2 days) | **Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [PHASE-1-CRITICAL] [BLOCKING]

**What**: Attack commands (melee + ranged), damage application, range validation, manual dummy enemy combat testing

**Why**:
- **BLOCKS Phase 1 validation** - cannot prove "time-unit combat is fun" without attacks
- Completes core combat loop: Movement ‚Üí FOV ‚Üí Turn Queue ‚Üí **Attacks** ‚Üí Health/Death
- Foundation for Enemy AI (VS_011)

**How**:
- **Phase 1 (Domain)**: `Weapon` value object (damage, time cost, range, weapon type enum)
- **Phase 2 (Application)**: `ExecuteAttackCommand` (attacker, target, weapon), range validation (melee=adjacent, ranged=FOV line-of-sight), integrates with existing `TakeDamageCommand` from VS_001
- **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)**: Attack validation service (checks adjacency for melee, FOV visibility for ranged)
- **Phase 4 (Presentation)**: Attack button UI (enabled when valid target in range), manual dummy control (WASD for enemy, Arrow keys for player)

**Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Melee attacks (adjacent tiles only, 8-directional)
- ‚úÖ Ranged attacks (FOV line-of-sight validation, max range)
- ‚úÖ Weapon time costs (integrate with TurnQueue from VS_007)
- ‚úÖ Death handling (actor reaches 0 health ‚Üí removed from queue)
- ‚ùå Enemy AI (dummy is manually controlled for testing)
- ‚ùå Multiple weapon types (just "sword" and "bow" for testing)
- ‚ùå Attack animations (instant damage for now)

**Done When**:
- Player can attack dummy enemy (melee when adjacent, ranged when visible)
- Dummy can attack player (manual WASD control)
- Health reduces on hit, actor dies at 0 HP
- Combat feels tactical (positioning matters for range/line-of-sight)
- Time costs advance turn queue correctly
- Can complete full combat: engage ‚Üí attack ‚Üí victory/defeat

**Dependencies**: VS_007 (Turn Queue - ‚úÖ complete)
**Next Step**: After combat feels fun ‚Üí VS_011 (Enemy AI uses these attack commands)

### VS_021: Internationalization (i18n) Infrastructure
**Status**: Approved | **Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer | **Size**: S-M (4-8 hours) | **Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TECHNICAL-DEBT-PREVENTION]

**What**: Godot i18n infrastructure with translation key discipline (architecture only, English translations only for now)

**Why**:
- Prevents catastrophic late-stage refactoring (10x cost if deferred)
- Aligns perfectly with Clean Architecture (Domain returns keys, Presentation calls `tr()`)
- Near-zero ongoing cost (just habit like using `Result<T>`)
- **Defers actual translation work** until Phase 1 validated (smart risk management)

**How**:
- **Phase 1**: Create `translations/` folder, configure Godot Project Settings ‚Üí Localization, create `en.csv` with English keys
- **Phase 2**: Refactor existing UI text to use `tr("UI_*")` keys (buttons, labels in test scenes)
- **Phase 3**: Add `name_key` to Actor entity (e.g., `"ACTOR_PLAYER"`, `"ACTOR_GOBLIN"`), update logging to use `tr(actor.name_key)`
- **Phase 4**: Document pattern in CLAUDE.md (all new UI must use keys, Domain returns keys not strings)

**Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Translation file structure (`translations/en.csv`)
- ‚úÖ Godot localization configuration
- ‚úÖ Refactor existing UI to use keys
- ‚úÖ Actor display names use keys (fixes "random code" in logs)
- ‚úÖ Architectural pattern documented
- ‚ùå Chinese/Japanese translations (deferred until Phase 1 validated)
- ‚ùå Pluralization support (`tr_n()` - add when needed)
- ‚ùå Cultural adaptation (future work)

**Done When**:
- All UI text uses `tr("UI_KEY")` pattern
- Logs show `"Player attacks Goblin"` instead of `"Actor_a3f attacks Actor_b7d"`
- `en.csv` contains all current keys
- CLAUDE.md documents i18n discipline for future work
- Zero hardcoded user-facing strings in codebase
- Adding Chinese later = just create `zh_CN.csv` (no code changes)

**Dependencies**: None (can be done parallel with VS_019/020)
**Integration**: Works with VS_020 (attack messages use keys)
