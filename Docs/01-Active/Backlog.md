## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### VS_020: Basic Combat System (Attacks & Damage)
**Status**: Ready for Testing (Phase 4 complete) | **Owner**: Dev Engineer | **Size**: M (1-2 days) | **Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [PHASE-1-CRITICAL] [BLOCKING]

**What**: Attack commands (melee + ranged), damage application, range validation, manual dummy enemy combat testing

**Progress** (2025-10-06 19:15):
- ‚úÖ **Phase 0 Complete** - Component Pattern Infrastructure (commit 7f299d7)
  - Created component system: IComponent, Actor (container), IHealthComponent, IWeaponComponent
  - Weapon value object: damage, time cost, range, type (Melee/Ranged)
  - IActorRepository + InMemoryActorRepository (two-system tracking)
  - ActorFactory.CreateFromTemplate() with conditional component assembly
  - ActorTemplate extended with weapon properties
  - ActorIdLoggingExtensions enhanced: "shortId [type: Type, name: ACTOR_KEY]"
  - DI registration in GameStrapper
  - All 415 tests GREEN ‚úÖ
  - Architecture: Component pattern scales to 50+ actor types (write once, reuse everywhere)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete** - Domain Layer (already done in Phase 0)
  - Weapon value object created with all required properties
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 Complete** - ExecuteAttackCommand (commit 7104295)
  - ExecuteAttackCommand(AttackerId, TargetId) with AttackResult
  - Range validation: Melee (adjacent, Chebyshev distance), Ranged (distance check)
  - Damage application via HealthComponent.TakeDamage()
  - TurnQueue integration: Reschedule attacker with weapon time cost
  - Death handling: Remove defeated actors from queue
  - 10 new tests covering happy path, validation, edge cases
  - All 425 tests GREEN ‚úÖ (415 existing + 10 new)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 Complete** - Line-of-Sight Validation (commit a811e41)
  - Integrated IFOVService + GridMap into ExecuteAttackCommandHandler
  - Ranged attacks now validate line-of-sight (FOV visibility check)
  - Walls/obstacles block ranged attacks (tactical positioning matters)
  - Melee attacks bypass FOV check (can attack around corners, in darkness)
  - 3 new tests: LOS blocked, LOS clear, melee independence
  - All 428 tests GREEN ‚úÖ (425 existing + 3 new)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4 Complete** - Presentation Layer (commit pending)
  - Click-to-attack: Click enemy to attack (replaces click-to-move when targeting enemy)
  - Test scene updated: TurnQueueTestScene.tscn now combat-ready
  - Actors created with health + weapons: Player (100HP/melee), Goblin (30HP/melee), Orc (50HP/ranged)
  - Visual feedback: Damage/death logged to console with emojis (‚öîÔ∏èüí•‚ò†Ô∏è)
  - Death removes enemy from grid (visual disappearance)
  - No button UI needed - intuitive click-to-attack

**Testing Instructions** (godot_project/test_scenes/TurnQueueTestScene.tscn):
1. **Open Scene**: Load TurnQueueTestScene.tscn in Godot Editor ‚Üí Press F5 to run
2. **Movement**: Left-click floor tiles to move player (blue square) toward enemies
3. **FOV Reveals Enemies**:
   - Goblin (red) at (15,15) appears when you get close (FOV range ~10 tiles)
   - Orc (orange) at (20,20) appears at longer range
4. **Melee Combat** (Player vs Goblin):
   - Move adjacent to Goblin (distance = 1 tile, 8-directional)
   - Left-click Goblin to attack (melee sword, 20 damage)
   - Check console for: `‚öîÔ∏è Attacking enemy` ‚Üí `üí• Attack hit! Dealt 20 damage. Target HP: 10`
   - Click Goblin again (2nd hit kills: 10 HP remaining ‚Üí 0 HP)
   - Check console for: `‚ò†Ô∏è Enemy defeated!`
   - Goblin disappears from grid (removed from ActorPositionService)
5. **Ranged Combat** (Orc):
   - Orc has ranged weapon (bow, range 8 tiles)
   - Stand 5-8 tiles away from Orc (within range, line-of-sight clear)
   - Orc should be visible in FOV
   - Try attacking (currently player has melee, will fail with "out of range")
6. **Range Validation**:
   - Try attacking Goblin from 2+ tiles away ‚Üí Error: "Target out of melee range"
   - Stand behind wall, try attacking through wall ‚Üí Error: "Target not visible (line-of-sight blocked)"
7. **Expected Results**:
   - ‚úÖ Player can attack adjacent enemies (melee works)
   - ‚úÖ Damage reduces enemy HP (logged to console)
   - ‚úÖ 2 hits kill Goblin (30 HP / 20 damage = 2 attacks)
   - ‚úÖ Dead enemies disappear from grid
   - ‚úÖ Attacks blocked by range/LOS show error messages

**Why**:
- **BLOCKS Phase 1 validation** - cannot prove "time-unit combat is fun" without attacks
- Completes core combat loop: Movement ‚Üí FOV ‚Üí Turn Queue ‚Üí **Attacks** ‚Üí Health/Death
- Foundation for Enemy AI (VS_011)

**How**:
- **Phase 0 (Foundation - Component Pattern + ADR-006 Integration)** (2-3 hours):
  - **Step 1: Component Infrastructure** (30 min)
    - Create `IComponent` base interface (Domain/Components/)
    - Create `Actor` entity as component container (Dictionary<Type, IComponent>)
    - Implement `AddComponent<T>()`, `GetComponent<T>()`, `HasComponent<T>()` methods
  - **Step 2: Health Component** (30 min)
    - Create `IHealthComponent` interface (TakeDamage, Heal, CurrentHealth, IsAlive)
    - Create `HealthComponent` implementation (wraps Health value object)
    - Unit tests: component isolation, damage reduction, death detection
  - **Step 3: Weapon Component** (30 min)
    - Create `IWeaponComponent` interface (Weapon property, CanAttack validation)
    - Create `WeaponComponent` implementation (wraps Weapon value object)
    - Unit tests: weapon validation, range checks
  - **Step 4: Repository + Factory** (45 min)
    - Create `IActorRepository` interface (GetActor, AddActor, RemoveActor)
    - Create `InMemoryActorRepository` implementation
    - Create `ActorFactory.CreateFromTemplate()` - conditionally adds components based on template
    - Register in DI container (GameStrapper)
  - **Step 5: Logging Integration** (15 min)
    - Update `ActorIdLoggingExtensions.ToLogString()` to use `IActorRepository.GetActor().NameKey`
    - Inject `IActorRepository` into 6 handlers (MoveActor, GetVisibleActors, etc.)
    - Result: Logs show `"8c2de643 [type: Enemy, name: ACTOR_GOBLIN]"`
  - **Deliverable**: Reusable component system - write HealthComponent ONCE, use for player/enemies/bosses/NPCs
- **Phase 1 (Domain)**: `Weapon` value object (damage, time cost, range, weapon type enum)
- **Phase 2 (Application)**: `ExecuteAttackCommand` (attacker, target, weapon), range validation (melee=adjacent, ranged=FOV line-of-sight), integrates with existing `TakeDamageCommand` from VS_001
- **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)**: Attack validation service (checks adjacency for melee, FOV visibility for ranged)
- **Phase 4 (Presentation)**: Attack button UI (enabled when valid target in range), manual dummy control (WASD for enemy, Arrow keys for player)

**Scope**:
- ‚úÖ Melee attacks (adjacent tiles only, 8-directional)
- ‚úÖ Ranged attacks (FOV line-of-sight validation, max range)
- ‚úÖ Weapon time costs (integrate with TurnQueue from VS_007)
- ‚úÖ Death handling (actor reaches 0 health ‚Üí removed from queue)
- ‚ùå Enemy AI (dummy is manually controlled for testing)
- ‚ùå Multiple weapon types (just "sword" and "bow" for testing)
- ‚ùå Attack animations (instant damage for now)

**Done When**:
- Player can attack dummy enemy (melee when adjacent, ranged when visible)
- Dummy can attack player (manual WASD control)
- Health reduces on hit, actor dies at 0 HP
- Combat feels tactical (positioning matters for range/line-of-sight)
- Time costs advance turn queue correctly
- Can complete full combat: engage ‚Üí attack ‚Üí victory/defeat

**Dependencies**:
- VS_007 (Turn Queue) - ‚úÖ complete
- VS_021 (i18n + Templates) - ‚úÖ complete (2025-10-06)
- Logging Enhancement - ‚úÖ complete (2025-10-06 15:38) - foundation for actor name display

**Tech Lead Decision - Phase 0 Architecture** (2025-10-06 16:17):

**Component Pattern (Chosen) vs Simple Entity**:
- **Decision**: Use component pattern (Actor as component container) instead of simple entity (Actor with properties)
- **Why Components**:
  - ‚úÖ **Massive reusability** - Write `HealthComponent` ONCE, use for player/enemies/bosses/NPCs/merchants (5+ actor types)
  - ‚úÖ **Scales to 50+ actor types** - Roguelikes need many enemies/NPCs, components prevent code duplication
  - ‚úÖ **Flexible composition** - Player has Equipment, enemies don't; Boss has Phases, others don't (mix and match)
  - ‚úÖ **Template integration** - Designer configures components in `.tres` files (HasHealth, HasEquipment flags)
  - ‚úÖ **Matches ADR-002** - Architecture explicitly designed for component pattern (line 62-138)
  - ‚úÖ **Easy to extend** - Add StatusEffectComponent later ‚Üí ALL actors get buffs/debuffs automatically
- **Why NOT simple entity**: Leads to logic duplication when 5+ actor types need same features (copy-paste Health logic)
- **Trade-off**: +1 hour upfront (components vs properties), but saves 3+ hours after 5th actor type (reuse pays off)

**ADR-006 Compliance**:
- Templates (Infrastructure) ‚Üí ActorFactory reads template ‚Üí Creates Actor with components (Domain)
- Actor entity has NO reference to template (data copied during spawn)
- Components are pure C# (zero Godot dependency)

**Architecture Layers**:
- `IComponent` base interface ‚Üí Domain/Components/
- `IHealthComponent`, `IWeaponComponent` ‚Üí Domain/Components/
- `Actor` entity (component container) ‚Üí Domain/Entities/
- `IActorRepository` interface ‚Üí Application/Repositories/
- `InMemoryActorRepository` ‚Üí Infrastructure/Repositories/
- `ActorFactory` (template ‚Üí entity + components) ‚Üí Application/Factories/

**Two-System Tracking**:
- `IActorRepository` (WHO: name, health, weapon components)
- `IActorPositionService` (WHERE: grid coordinates)
- Both use ActorId as linking key

**Next Step**: After combat feels fun ‚Üí VS_011 (Enemy AI uses these attack commands)
