[Overall Assessment]:
A strong, pragmatic ADR that thoughtfully applies DDD bounded contexts to a single-player Godot/C# game. It balances modular isolation, determinism, and UI/event concerns well. However, it contains several internal inconsistencies (notably around event buses, determinism vs timestamps, contracts identity types, and domain dependency on MediatR) and a few code-level pitfalls that should be corrected to avoid maintenance and performance issues.

[Strengths]:
- Clear module boundaries: Contracts assemblies, isolation tests, and context mapping are well-articulated and enforceable.
- Determinism-first: Concrete test strategy to ban non-deterministic constructs in core gameplay.
- Event taxonomy: Sensible separation of Domain, Contract, and Application notifications.
- Practical Godot guidance: Main-thread marshaling and DI bootstrap patterns fit Godot’s scene lifecycle.
- VSA + DDD alignment: Good guidance for feature placement and vertical slice structure.
- Performance awareness: Explicit “no MediatR in hot paths” guidance and batch/coarse-grained events.
- Implementation protocol: Phased steps, architecture tests, and versioning discipline are production-friendly.

[Potential Risks & Areas for Improvement]:
- Problem Description: Contradiction between “single MediatR” vs adding a separate integration event bus.
  Reasoning: The ADR states a single bus with interface differentiation, but later registers `IIntegrationEventBus` and uses it for tick events, and the “Benefits” explicitly say “single event bus.” This ambiguity will cause duplicated patterns and confusion for handlers and testing.

- Problem Description: Determinism conflict: domain events use DateTime in a domain that bans DateTime.
  Reasoning: Domain event example includes `DateTime OccurredAt` while determinism tests forbid DateTime in Tactical domain.
```174:181:Docs/03-Reference/ADR/ADR-017-ddd-bounded-contexts-architecture.md
public record ActorDamagedEvent(ActorId Actor, int Damage) : IDomainEvent
{
    public DateTime OccurredAt { get; } = DateTime.UtcNow;
}
```
```714:737:Docs/03-Reference/ADR/ADR-017-ddd-bounded-contexts-architecture.md
Types.InAssembly(tacticalAssembly)
    .Should()
    .NotHaveDependencyOn("System.DateTime")
```

- Problem Description: Domain dependency on MediatR via `IDomainEvent : INotification`.
  Reasoning: This couples the domain to a transport library, reducing purity and testability. It also conflicts with the stated goal of strong isolation.

- Problem Description: Strongly-typed ID equality and default value hazards.
  Reasoning: `TypedIdValueBase` equality compares any `TypedIdValueBase` by value, enabling cross-type equality. `record struct ActorId(EntityId Value)` allows a default `ActorId` with null `EntityId`, risking null refs and bypassing invariants.

- Problem Description: Contracts identity inconsistency (Guid vs EntityId).
  Reasoning: The ADR alternates between `Guid` and `EntityId` for cross-context identity. This inconsistency will multiply mapping code and create subtle bugs when migrating.

- Problem Description: MainThreadDispatcher sample has non-existent Godot API and weak main-thread detection.
  Reasoning: `GetProcessThread()` doesn’t exist; main thread checks should be based on captured managed thread ID or always-queue pattern. Current example risks misuse and confusion.

- Problem Description: `Entity.DomainEvents` can be null.
  Reasoning: Returning null for a collection property is error-prone. Consumers must null-check; iterating will crash.

- Problem Description: MediatR handler lifetimes set to Singleton globally.
  Reasoning: Singletons are fine for stateless handlers, but pipeline behaviors and handlers that use transient dependencies (e.g., per-operation context) may break assumptions or capture unintended state.

- Problem Description: Over-segmentation risk with many csproj.
  Reasoning: For a single-player game, too many assemblies can slow iteration and create config overhead. The ADR partially mitigates this but could be more incremental.

- Problem Description: Architecture test examples depend on unspecified tooling and fragile pattern-matching.
  Reasoning: NetArchTest/ArchUnit.NET assumptions aren’t explicitly stated; reflection-based float bans might false-positive or miss nested generics; excluding `INotificationHandler<>` broadly may also hide legitimate violations.

[Specific Suggestions & Alternatives]:
- Unify event bus story:
  - Option A (simpler): Single MediatR for Domain and Contract events; no separate bus. Keep “no hot-path” guidance; for per-frame events, use direct service calls and batch notifications at frame end.
  - Option B (performant): Clearly define two buses:
    - MediatR: Domain and Contract events only (non-hot-path).
    - Lightweight in-process bus for high-frequency/coarse tick events (no DI, struct payloads, lock-free queue).
```csharp
public interface IFrameEventBus {
    void Publish(in TickCompletedEvent evt);
    IDisposable Subscribe(Action<TickCompletedEvent> handler);
}

public sealed class FrameEventBus : IFrameEventBus {
    private readonly ConcurrentBag<Action<TickCompletedEvent>> _subscribers = new();
    public void Publish(in TickCompletedEvent evt) { foreach (var s in _subscribers) s(evt); }
    public IDisposable Subscribe(Action<TickCompletedEvent> handler) { _subscribers.Add(handler); return new Unsubscriber(_subscribers, handler); }
}
```
  - Document the division explicitly and remove “single bus” claims if choosing Option B.

- Remove DateTime from domain events:
  - Replace with deterministic time markers:
    - Use `int TickNumber`, `long SimulationTimeUs`, or a `readonly struct GameTime { public int Tick; }`.
  - Keep timestamps for Application/Contract events only, added at the adapter stage.
```csharp
public readonly record struct GameTick(int Value);
public readonly record ActorDamagedEvent(ActorId Actor, int Damage, GameTick Tick) : IDomainEvent;
```

- Decouple domain from MediatR:
  - Define `IDomainEvent` in SharedKernel with no external inheritance.
  - Application publishes domain events via a publisher/adapter that bridges to MediatR.
```csharp
// SharedKernel.Domain
public interface IDomainEvent { }

// Application adapter
public interface IDomainEventPublisher { Task PublishAsync(IDomainEvent evt, CancellationToken ct); }

public sealed class MediatRDomainEventPublisher(IMediator mediator) : IDomainEventPublisher {
    public Task PublishAsync(IDomainEvent evt, CancellationToken ct) =>
        mediator.Publish(evt, ct); // With a wrapper/marker if needed
}
```

- Fix strongly-typed IDs:
  - Make base equality type-safe and prevent cross-type equality:
```csharp
public abstract class TypedId<TSelf> : IEquatable<TSelf>
    where TSelf : TypedId<TSelf>
{
    public Guid Value { get; }
    protected TypedId(Guid value) { if (value == Guid.Empty) throw new InvalidOperationException("Empty"); Value = value; }
    public bool Equals(TSelf? other) => other is not null && other.Value == Value;
    public override bool Equals(object? obj) => obj is TSelf other && Equals(other);
    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(typeof(TSelf), Value);
    public override string ToString() => Value.ToString("N")[..8];
}
public sealed class EntityId : TypedId<EntityId> { public EntityId(Guid v) : base(v) {} public static EntityId New() => new(Guid.NewGuid()); }
```
  - For `ActorId`, avoid nested class-in-class wrapping that can be null by default. Prefer:
```csharp
public readonly record struct ActorId(Guid Value) {
    public static ActorId New() => new(Guid.NewGuid());
    public bool IsEmpty => Value == Guid.Empty;
}
```
  - Or adopt a battle-tested source generator (e.g., StronglyTypedId) for consistency and analyzer support.

- Standardize contracts identity:
  - Prefer using `EntityId` (from SharedKernel) across Contract events for type-safety and consistency with Diagnostics, or commit to `Guid` everywhere. Pick one and document it. If `EntityId`, ensure Contracts reference only SharedKernel and not domain.
```csharp
public sealed record ActorDamagedContractEvent(EntityId EntityId, int Damage, string ActorName) : IContractEvent { /* Id, OccurredAt, Version */ }
```

- Correct MainThreadDispatcher:
  - Remove invalid API usage and use captured main thread ID, or always enqueue and accept a one-frame delay.
```csharp
public sealed partial class MainThreadDispatcher : Node, IMainThreadDispatcher {
    private readonly ConcurrentQueue<Action> _queue = new();
    private int _mainThreadId;

    public override void _EnterTree() {
        _mainThreadId = Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId;
        ProcessMode = ProcessModeEnum.Always;
    }

    public override void _Process(double delta) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10 && _queue.TryDequeue(out var action); i++) {
            try { action(); } catch (Exception ex) { GD.PrintErr(ex.ToString()); }
        }
    }

    private bool IsOnMainThread() => Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId == _mainThreadId;

    public void Enqueue(Action action) {
        if (IsOnMainThread()) action();
        else _queue.Enqueue(action);
    }
}
```

- Make `Entity.DomainEvents` safe to consume:
```csharp
public IReadOnlyCollection<IDomainEvent> DomainEvents =>
    (IReadOnlyCollection<IDomainEvent>?)_domainEvents ?? Array.Empty<IDomainEvent>();
```

- Review MediatR lifetimes:
  - Keep handlers stateless; if any handler relies on transient state, register those specific handlers/transforms as Transient. Pipeline behaviors are commonly Transient; confirm and document.
  - Consider `ValueTask` in handlers to reduce allocations for hot-ish paths.

- Incremental assembly rollout:
  - Start by splitting only SharedKernel and Contracts assemblies; keep Tactical and Diagnostics as folders in a single Core assembly with namespace separation plus analyzers/ArchTests to enforce isolation.
  - Split into separate assemblies once boundaries stabilize. This reduces churn without sacrificing discipline.

- Clarify and harden architecture tests:
  - Specify tool (NetArchTest or ArchUnitNET) and add build script integration.
  - For float/double bans, check fields and properties recursively; allow `[DeterministicAllowed]` attribute on whitelisted types.
  - Narrow the `INotificationHandler<>` exclusion to only contract-event handlers, or exclude by namespace or attribute (e.g., `[IntegrationAdapter]`) to avoid hiding real violations.

- Document exception policy with Fin<T>:
  - If domain guard clauses throw `BusinessRuleValidationException`, show the application-layer translation to `Fin<T>` to uphold “no exceptions across boundaries.”
```csharp
try {
    aggregate.DoWork();
    return FinSucc(Unit.Default);
}
catch (BusinessRuleValidationException ex) {
    return FinFail<Unit>(Error.New(ex.Message));
}
```

[Questions for Clarification]:
- Should the architecture use a single event bus (MediatR) or two buses (MediatR + lightweight frame bus)? If two, which events go where? Please confirm and update the ADR to remove ambiguity.
- Do you want `EntityId` in Contracts, or plain `Guid`? Diagnostics examples use `EntityId`. Let’s standardize.
- Is it acceptable for the domain to reference MediatR? If not, we should remove `INotification` inheritance from `IDomainEvent` and bridge in the application layer.
- Confirm desired time representation for domain events: `TickNumber`/`GameTime` instead of `DateTime` to pass determinism tests?
- Which architecture test framework will be used (NetArchTest or ArchUnitNET), and do you want attributes (e.g., `[IntegrationAdapter]`) to control exclusions more precisely?
- Which Godot version (4.2/4.3/4.4)? This affects recommended threading APIs and minor DI/SDK guidance.
- Are there performance targets for per-frame GC allocations? If so, we can propose `struct` event payloads and `ValueTask` use where appropriate.
