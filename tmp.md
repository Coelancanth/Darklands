### [Overall Assessment]
A strong, well-reasoned ADR that correctly applies DDD bounded contexts to resolve current determinism and coupling issues, with pragmatic patterns for MediatR, DI, and Godot isolation. The intent is solid and feasible; a few important execution details need tightening (assembly boundaries, DI scope semantics in Godot, main-thread marshaling, and ensuring context isolation in examples).

### [Strengths]
- **Clear problem framing**: Identifies determinism conflicts, mixed concerns, and testing constraints precisely.
- **Correct DDD direction**: Sensible separation into Tactical, Diagnostics, Platform, SharedKernel, and Presentation.
- **Integration events discipline**: Distinguishes domain vs. integration events and avoids domain types at boundaries.
- **Godot isolation**: Maintains a clean presenter/view split and keeps Tactical unaware of Godot.
- **Per-context DI registration**: Encourages modular composition roots over a single monolithic container.
- **Architecture tests**: Enforces determinism and dependency boundaries per context.
- **Incremental rollout plan**: Phased migration acknowledges complexity and risk.
- **Shared kernel minimalism**: Limits shared types to identities, math, and results.
- **Context mapping patterns**: Uses customer-supplier and ACL appropriately for Diagnostics and Platform.
- **Realistic MediatR usage**: Places handlers in the right layers and shows bridging patterns.

### [Potential Risks & Areas for Improvement]
1) **Problem Description**: Context isolation violation in example  
   **Reasoning**: `Diagnostics.Domain` uses `Dictionary<ActorId, double>`. `ActorId` is Tactical domain. This breaks the “no direct references” rule and undermines context independence.

2) **Problem Description**: Namespaces-only vs. assemblies  
   **Reasoning**: Relying on namespaces without separate assemblies weakens enforcement (the compiler can’t prevent cross-references). Architecture tests help but are not sufficient to stop accidental dependencies.

3) **Problem Description**: MediatR used for both domain and integration events on the same bus  
   **Reasoning**: Sharing a single publish pipeline couples concerns and makes it easier to accidentally handle integration events inside Tactical, complicating behaviors and performance tuning.

4) **Problem Description**: Godot main-thread constraints  
   **Reasoning**: Handlers may run on thread pool threads. Any Godot API access must occur on the main thread; otherwise crashes or undefined behavior can occur.

5) **Problem Description**: DI Scoped lifetime semantics in a non-HTTP game loop  
   **Reasoning**: `AddScoped` requires explicit scope creation and disposal. Without a clear “request scope” (e.g., per-tick, per-command), services can leak or be misused.

6) **Problem Description**: Per-frame performance with MediatR/event storms  
   **Reasoning**: Publishing fine-grained domain events every frame can create allocations, GC pressure, and latency. MediatR is best for app-level workflows, not tight hot loops.

7) **Problem Description**: Determinism enforcement unspecified details  
   **Reasoning**: “NotUseFloatingPoint()” and “No DateTime/Random” rules are outlined but not concretely implemented. LINQ ordering, culture/formatting, and concurrency can also break determinism.

8) **Problem Description**: Integration event versioning and backpressure  
   **Reasoning**: Integration events lack versioning and QoS. As the system evolves, events may need schema changes; bursts of events can overwhelm consumers.

9) **Problem Description**: Composition root timing and storage in Godot  
   **Reasoning**: Building the container in a Node `_Ready()` risks order-of-initialization issues. Access patterns for services across Nodes are unspecified, inviting a Service Locator anti-pattern.

10) **Problem Description**: Presentation depending on domain events  
    **Reasoning**: Presenter’s `OnActorMoved(ActorMovedEvent evt)` ties UI to Tactical’s domain event types. While Presentation is a layer (not a context), app-level notifications or view models provide better decoupling.

11) **Problem Description**: Platform feature detection and environment branching  
    **Reasoning**: `Engine.IsEditorHint()` is fine, but run-time platform differences (tools, headless, mobile) may require broader feature flags and a single place to decide.

12) **Problem Description**: LanguageExt in SharedKernel  
    **Reasoning**: `Fin<T>` is fine, but SharedKernel becomes a transitive dependency for every context. Ensure this is intentional and acceptable for build size and allocations.

### [Specific Suggestions & Alternatives]
1) **Fix Diagnostics identity coupling**  
   Use shared identity types in SharedKernel and keep Tactical’s `ActorId` internal to Tactical.  
   ```csharp
   // SharedKernel.Identity
   public readonly record struct EntityId(string Value);
   
   // Diagnostics.Domain
   public record VisionPerformanceReport(
       DateTime Timestamp,
       double CalculationTimeMs,
       Dictionary<EntityId, double> Metrics);
   ```

2) **Enforce assembly boundaries**  
   Split contexts into separate class libraries and reference them from the Godot game project. Keep all Godot-facing Nodes in the Godot project.  
   ```xml
   <!-- Darklands.csproj -->
   <ItemGroup>
     <ProjectReference Include="src/Tactical/Darklands.Tactical.Domain.csproj" />
     <ProjectReference Include="src/Tactical/Darklands.Tactical.Application.csproj" />
     <ProjectReference Include="src/Diagnostics/Darklands.Diagnostics.Domain.csproj" />
     <ProjectReference Include="src/Diagnostics/Darklands.Diagnostics.Application.csproj" />
     <ProjectReference Include="src/Platform/Darklands.Platform.Domain.csproj" />
     <ProjectReference Include="src/Platform/Darklands.Platform.Infrastructure.Godot.csproj" />
     <ProjectReference Include="src/SharedKernel/Darklands.SharedKernel.csproj" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

3) **Separate integration event bus**  
   Keep domain events on MediatR; wrap integration events in a dedicated bus so you can add policies (versioning, buffering, logging) without affecting domain events.  
   ```csharp
   public interface IIntegrationEvent { int Version { get; } }
   public interface IIntegrationEventBus { Task Publish(IIntegrationEvent evt, CancellationToken ct); }
   public sealed class MediatRIntegrationEventBus : IIntegrationEventBus {
     private readonly IPublisher _publisher;
     public MediatRIntegrationEventBus(IPublisher publisher) => _publisher = publisher;
     public Task Publish(IIntegrationEvent evt, CancellationToken ct) => _publisher.Publish(evt, ct);
   }
   ```

4) **Main-thread dispatcher for Godot**  
   Ensure all Godot API calls are marshaled to the main thread.  
   ```csharp
   public interface IMainThreadDispatcher { void Enqueue(Action action); }
   
   public sealed partial class MainThreadDispatcher : Node, IMainThreadDispatcher {
     private readonly System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue<Action> _queue = new();
     public override void _Process(double delta) {
       while (_queue.TryDequeue(out var a)) a();
     }
     public void Enqueue(Action action) => _queue.Enqueue(action);
   }
   
   // Usage in handlers/presenters
   _dispatcher.Enqueue(() => _view.SetPosition(x, y));
   ```

5) **Define DI scope policy**  
   Create scopes explicitly per “application operation” (e.g., per command) or avoid `Scoped` entirely.  
   ```csharp
   // Per-command scope
   using var scope = _provider.CreateScope();
   var mediator = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IMediator>();
   await mediator.Send(command, ct);
   ```

6) **Avoid MediatR in hot paths**  
   - Use direct service calls for per-frame simulation.  
   - Batch domain changes and publish a single coarse-grained event per tick.  
   ```csharp
   // Tactical.Application game loop
   public void SimulateTick(GameTick tick) {
     _combatScheduler.Advance(tick);
     _visionSystem.UpdateForAllActors();
     // at end: _eventPublisher.Publish(new TickCompleted(...))
   }
   ```

7) **Concrete determinism guards**  
   - Architecture tests: ban `System.Double`, `System.Single`, `System.DateTime`, `System.Random`.  
   - Roslyn analyzer or NetArchTest custom conditions checking IL references.  
   ```csharp
   Types.InAssembly(typeof(Darklands.Tactical.Domain.Marker).Assembly)
     .Should().NotHaveDependencyOn("System.Double")
     .And().NotHaveDependencyOn("System.Single")
     .And().NotHaveDependencyOn("System.DateTime")
     .And().NotHaveDependencyOn("System.Random")
     .GetResult().IsSuccessful.Should().BeTrue();
   ```
   - Enforce deterministic collections and explicit ordering; avoid culture-sensitive APIs.

8) **Version and buffer integration events**  
   Add version and optional metadata; consider bounded queues for Diagnostics.  
   ```csharp
   public sealed record CombatMetricRecordedEvent(
     string ActorId, long TimestampTicks, string MetricType, int Version = 1) : IIntegrationEvent;
   ```

9) **Robust composition root**  
   - Initialize DI in an Autoload (Singleton) Node before scenes load.  
   - Expose factories instead of a service locator; pass presenters into views via setup methods.  
   ```csharp
   public sealed partial class Bootstrapper : Node {
     public static IServiceProvider Services { get; private set; } = default!;
     public override void _EnterTree() {
       var sc = new ServiceCollection();
       sc.AddTacticalContext().AddDiagnosticsContext().AddPlatformContext();
       sc.AddSingleton<IMainThreadDispatcher>(GetNode<MainThreadDispatcher>("/root/Dispatcher"));
       Services = sc.BuildServiceProvider();
     }
   }
   ```

10) **UI decoupling from domain events**  
   Prefer application-level notifications or view models over direct domain events in Presentation.  
   ```csharp
   public sealed record ActorMovedNotification(EntityId Actor, Position NewPosition) : INotification; // Application
   ```

11) **Centralize platform feature detection**  
   Provide a `IRuntimeEnvironment` with `IsEditor`, `IsHeadless`, `Platform` to drive DI choices consistently.

12) **SharedKernel dependency policy**  
   If LanguageExt is retained, document it explicitly as a deliberate dependency. Alternatively, wrap `Fin<T>` behind your own `Result<T>` to limit transitive impact.

### [Questions for Clarification]
- Should contexts be enforced as separate assemblies, or remain namespaces within one assembly during Phase 1? If assemblies, which project boundaries do you want first?
- Is it acceptable to move all Godot-facing classes into the main game project and keep contexts as pure .NET libraries?
- What is the intended scope lifetime? Per command, per tick, or avoided entirely?
- Do you want a dedicated integration event bus abstraction, or keep MediatR for both with conventions?
- Can we switch Diagnostics to shared identity types now (replacing `ActorId`), or do you prefer a transitional mapping layer first?
- Are we targeting deterministic builds across platforms (Windows/Linux/macOS), and do we need to pin culture and threading behavior for replays?
- How hot is the Tactical loop (target FPS/actors/events)? This influences whether MediatR appears in any hot path.
- Should integration events include versioning and metadata (trace IDs) out of the gate?
- Where do you want the composition root to live (Autoload Bootstrapper) and how should presenters be constructed/connected to Nodes?
- Are we comfortable with LanguageExt in SharedKernel for the long term, or should we plan a lightweight internal `Result<T>`?

- I can draft the initial assembly split and the Godot bootstrapper next; confirm preferences on assemblies and DI scope and I’ll implement accordingly.
