Of course. Here is the complete translation of your game design overview, formatted to match the original.

### **Game Genre Name**

**"Organic Narrative Tactical RPG"**

### **Core Design Philosophy**

The core of this game is **"Emergent Narrative."** It does not tell a story through a pre-written plot. Instead, it provides a set of deeply interconnected, organic systems, allowing **player actions** to interact with a **proactive AI director**. This generates a legendary story that is unique and exclusive to each playthrough. The growth of characters, the challenges of the world, the outcomes of battles, and the loot obtained collectively constitute the story itself.

### **The Five Pillars of the Design Blueprint**

#### **1. The Macro Loop: The Expedition & Survival Loop**

* **Inspiration:** *Stoneshard*, *Battle Brothers*
* **Core Mechanics:** The player manages a small squad, setting out from one or more safe strongholds (towns) into a dangerous, procedurally generated world to undertake expeditions. The objectives of these expeditions are dynamically generated by the **AI Storyteller** (see Pillar 5). The player must manage resources such as food, medicine, and morale, returning to a stronghold for rest, resupply, and growth after resources are depleted or the mission is complete. This **"sally forth - return"** loop is the fundamental rhythm of the game.

#### **2. Tactical Combat: The High-Stakes Chess Match**

* **Inspiration:** *Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)*
* **Core Mechanics:**
    * **Action Delay System:** Combat is turn-based, but the right to act is determined by "action delay." Every action has a time cost, and faster units act more frequently. The UI must clearly and transparently communicate these time costs.
    * **Tactical Depth:** The core of combat lies in squad positioning, leveraging terrain, line of sight (LOS) control, and skill synergy. Every decision is critical, and the consequences of a mistake are fatal.
    * **Squad Synergy:** The combat system is designed around the squad, emphasizing cooperation between characters, such as a tank drawing fire, an assassin flanking, a mage providing area control, etc.

#### **3. Character Progression: Behavior as History**

* **Inspiration:** *Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord*
* **Core Mechanics:** A trinity of organic growth systems.
    * **Proficiency:** Characters improve their respective skills by **actually performing actions** in the game (swinging a sword, picking a lock, trading).
    * **Focus Points:** Points gained through leveling up, which the player uses to **actively invest** in skills they wish to develop, thereby **accelerating** the rate at which proficiency is gained. This is the player's strategic planning.
    * **Attributes:** Define a character's **aptitude and potential**. Attributes determine the learning cap and efficiency of related skills and provide fundamental passive bonuses.
    * **Emergent Roles:** A character's class and identity are not chosen at the start but **emerge naturally** from their actions and the player's development choices throughout the game.

#### **4. The Item System: Threat & Countermeasure**

* **Inspiration:** *Angband*
* **Core Mechanics:**
    * **Equipment as Solutions:** The core value of loot is not merely in statistical improvement but in its ability to **solve specific problems**. The world will constantly present various threats (poisonous monsters, psychic attacks, environmental hazards), and equipment provides the corresponding countermeasures (poison resistance, will saving throws, fire resistance).
    * **Random Affix Generation:** Utilizes the classic "prefix/suffix + base item" model to create a massive variety of magical items with unique combinations of properties.
    * **Artifact-Driven Adventure:** Unique artifacts with immense power and background stories are the ultimate goals of player expeditions. Their discovery is, in itself, a major narrative node.

#### **5. The Narrative System: The Dynamic Director**

* **Inspiration:** *RimWorld*
* **Core Mechanics:** The game is driven by an **AI Storyteller** behind the scenes.
    * **Proactive Event Injection:** The AI director, based on the player's status (strength, wealth, predicament) and a preset narrative pacing, will **proactively** inject events into the world, including threats, opportunities, and "flavor" events.
    * **Pacing Control:** The AI creates a tense **narrative arc**, including calm periods of rest, periods of escalating challenges, and dramatic climactic crises, ensuring a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.
    * **Personalized Experience:** Players can choose AI directors with different "personalities" (e.g., stable, peaceful, or completely random), thereby customizing the overall style and challenge curve of each playthrough.

### **Conclusion: The Final Gameplay Experience**

Players will take on the role of a mercenary squad leader, surviving and thriving in a procedural world full of opportunity and danger. They will experience adventures tailored by the AI director, facing battles that require wisdom and tactics to overcome. Their characters will grow authentically with every sword swung and every deal made. Every piece of powerful equipment they seek is to counter an impending threat, be it known or unknown.

Ultimately, when a player finishes a game, they will possess not just the satisfaction of completion, but a unique heroic epic—their very own—woven from countless meaningful choices and their consequences. This, is the game you have designed.
